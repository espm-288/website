    "text": "This tutorial demonstrates how begin to generalize the pattern introduced in the introductory example to work with other data sources, in particular, with NASA EarthData.\nNASA recently announced completion of the transfer of some 59 petabytes of data to the Amazon cloud – a core component of NASA’s Transformation to Open Science (TOPS) mission. Researchers are frequently told that to take advantage of such “cloud data” they will need to pay (or find a grant or other program to pay) for cloud computing resources. This approach is sometimes describes as “send the compute to the data”. While this narrative is no doubt beneficial to Amazon Inc, it exacerbates inequity and is often misleading. The purpose of having data in a cloud storage platform is not just to make it faster to access that data on rented cloud computing platforms. The high bandwith and high disk speeds provided by these systems can be just as powerful when you provide your own compute. Consistent with NASA’s vision, this means that high-performance access is free\n\nNASA Earth science data have been freely openly and available to all users since EOSDIS became operational in 1994. Under NASA’s full and open data policy, all NASA mission data (along with the algorithms, metadata, and documentation associated with these data) must be freely available to the public. This means that anyone, anywhere in the world, can access the more than 59 PB of NASA Earth science data without restriction\n\nAll we need is software that can treat the cloud storage as if it were local storage: a virtual filesystem. The ability to do this – the HTTP range request standard – has been around for over two decades and is widely implemented in open source software. Unfortunately, many users and workflows are stuck in an old model that assumes individual files must always be downloaded first.\nTo make this work with NASA EarthData however, we have one additional challenge involving the problem of authentication. NASA offers several different mechanisms, including (1) netrc authentication, (2) token-based authentication, and (3) S3 credentials, but only the first of these works equally well from locations both inside and outside of AWS-based compute, so there really is very little reason to learn the other two.\nThe earthdatalogin package in R or the earthaccess package in Python handle the authentication. The R package sets up authentication behind the scenes using environmental variables.\n\nearthdatalogin::edl_netrc()\n\n(A default login is supplied though users are encouraged to register for their own individual accounts.) Once this is in place, EarthData’s protected URLs can be used like any other. For instance, after authenticating, we can read this NASA harmonized LandSat-Sentinel2 tif whether we are running locally:\n\nterra::rast(\"https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/lp-prod-protected/HLSL30.020/HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0/HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA.tif\",\n     vsi=TRUE)\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 3660, 3660, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 30, 30  (x, y)\nextent      : 199980, 309780, 7190200, 7300000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : WGS 84 / UTM zone 56N (EPSG:32656) \nsource      : HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA.tif \nname        : HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA \n\n\nAn important aspect about this approach is that it does not require any custom wrappers or specialized functions to access data. Most R packages that work with spatial data, including terra, sf, stars and others, do so through the use of GDAL for parsing spatial data formats. This means that they all support the GDAL Virtual Filesystem for cloud-native reads out of the box. earthdatalogin() takes advantage of this by setting authentication credentials as GDAL environmental variable configuration, allowing these existing to seamlessly read NASA data. No need to learn any additional access functions.\n\n\n\nlibrary(earthdatalogin)\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\n\nearthdatalogin also includes optional configuration settings for GDAL which can improve performance of cloud-based data access. Set the GDAL environmental variables using gdal_cloud_config(). An additional helper function exposes the usual GDAL environmental variable to the gdalcubes R package.\n\nedl_netrc()           # Authenticate\ngdal_cloud_config()   # Optimize GDAL for cloud\nwith_gdalcubes()      # Export settings to gdalcubes package\n\ngdalcubes_options(parallel = TRUE)\n\nNASA provides their own search system. NASA also provides a STAC-based search (see below), which allows us to use the standard syntax we have already seen. However, NASA’s STAC API is significantly slower and more prone to server errors than the STAC APIs provided by Element84, Microsoft Planetary Computer, and others.\nHere, we use NASA’s own search protocol, which is less general, but gives us a chance to illustrate the use of gdalcubes using arbitrary URL lists when no STAC catalog is available. We search a handful of dates for illustrative purposes, but this approach can easily scale to larger lists without needing additional RAM or disk space.\n\nstart &lt;- \"2020-01-01\"\nend   &lt;- \"2020-01-03\" \nurls &lt;- edl_search(short_name = \"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n                   temporal = c(start, end))\n\nThese netcdf files lack appropriate metadata (projection, extent) that GDAL expects. We can provide this manually using the GDAL VRT mechanism:\n\nvrt &lt;- function(url) {\n  prefix &lt;-  \"vrt://NETCDF:/vsicurl/\"\n  suffix &lt;- \":analysed_sst?a_srs=OGC:CRS84&a_ullr=-180,90,180,-90\"\n  paste0(prefix, url, suffix)\n}\n\n# date associated with each file\nurl_dates &lt;- as.Date(gsub(\".*(\\\\d{8})\\\\d{6}.*\", \"\\\\1\", urls), format=\"%Y%m%d\")\n\nBecause each file in this list of URLs has the same spatial extent, resolution, and projection, we can now manually construct our space-time data cube from these netcdf slices:\n\ndata_gd &lt;- gdalcubes::stack_cube(vrt(urls), datetime_values = url_dates)\n\nWe use gdalcubes to crop each file\n\nextent = list(left=-93, right=-76, bottom=41, top=49,\n              t0=start, t1=end)\n\nbench::bench_time({\n  data_gd |&gt; \n    gdalcubes::crop(extent) |&gt; \n    aggregate_time(dt=\"P3D\", method=\"mean\") |&gt; \n    plot(col = viridisLite::viridis(10))\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess    real \n  2.29s  27.34s \n\n\n\n\n\nThe STAC Catalog search system we illustrated in the introductory example is a widely used standard. This means that we can use the same packages and same code we have already learned to access entirely different geospatial data products prepared by an entirely different provider. In this example, we will illustrate searching NASA’s EarthData catalog using the STAC interface. We can also browse the collection of NASA Earthdata STAC Catalogs in a web browser. (NOTE: Unfortunately, at this time, NASA’s implementation of the STAC standard is incomplete. The web browser only shows the first 10 entries under any heading, despite the NASA STAC API actually having the complete records. Also, NASA’s STAC service is considerably slower than those provided by Element84 or Microsoft Planetary Computer.)\n\nitems &lt;- stac(\"https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/POCLOUD\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(collections = \"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n              datetime = paste(start,end, sep = \"/\")) |&gt;\n  post_request() |&gt;\n  items_fetch()\n\nitems\n\n###STACItemCollection\n- matched feature(s): 3\n- features (3 item(s) / 0 not fetched):\n  - 20200101090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n  - 20200102090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n  - 20200103090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n- assets: data, metadata, opendap\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type",

Both the VSCode and RStudio editors run in the same underlying custom Docker container. This repository includes a Dockerfile defining this compute environment which includes specific versions of R and python packages, the latest releases of the OSGeo C libraries GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS that power many spatial operations in both languages. These elements are pre-compiled in a Docker container based on the latest Ubuntu LTS release (22.04 at the time of writing), which itself is build according to the Dockerfile found in this repository using a GitHub Action.

This uses the same Docker container and enables all the same extensions in VSCode, including RStudio server on the embedded port.\nOf course, users can open this project in a local VSCode or any other favorite editor without opening in the devcontainer. The user assumes responsibility to install necessary software, i.e. the packages listed in requirements.txt or install.R.

    "text": "Intro to GitHub & JupyterHub\nGitHub & Jupyter are two core platforms in our course and across data science. Over the course of this semester we will becoming very familiar with both, beginning with the most commonly used features and progressing to leveraging the more advanced corners of each.\n\nCloud Platforms\nBoth GitHub and JupyterHub are cloud based platforms. The term “cloud” is a fanciful way of saying that this software is running on “someone else’s computer,” usually (but not always), this means in a massive data center with rack upon rack of computers. Many of these data centers are owned by one of only a handful of ‘cloud providers’ – such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, or IBM, among others. In both cases, we will access these platforms through a web browser.\nA key concept that takes some getting used to is thinking about where our data ‘lives’ when working on these platforms. Remember that with each of these platforms, we are working on ‘someone else’s computer’. The browser only gives us a window into that computer. Documents you create on JupyterHub don’t automatically exist on your laptop. If your laptop completely died and you logged into JupyterHub on another platform, your work would still be there. However, if your partner logs into their JupyterHub, they are allocated their own separate computer. To share your work with your partner, your instructors, or the larger world, we will be using GitHub. GitHub is running on yet another computer (actually many connected computers), and we must push our work from the JupyterHub machine to GitHub, or pull changes from GitHub into JupyterHub. While many cloud-based services (like DropBox) automate some of these steps, data science tools such as git give us much more control of what and when we share.\n\n\nGitHub\nGitHub is a commercial website platform acquired by Microsoft and widely used by software developers for collaborative work on both public and private code bases. GitHub is built git, an open-source software for version control orginally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Many other open and proprietary platforms also use git as their foundation (notably GitLab and HuggingFace). While many other open source version control utilities exist besides git, git is easily the most widely used today. GitHub is a primary mechanism for ‘publishing’ or distributing software source-code, notebooks and much else. We will be using GitHub as a way of sharing code with your partner and submitting your assignments. While GitHub’s web interface is quite user friendly, the underlying technology of git has a reputation for being quite complex – in fact based on precisely the same technological ideas as the “block-chain”, although it has existed long before anyone decided to apply those ideas to currency. Many instructors therefore avoid teaching GitHub and git in courses!\n\nCreate an acount on GitHub\nUse the GitHub Classroom magic link distributed in class to create a GitHub repository under the course’s GitHub Organization espm-157.\n\nContinue below. As we progress, we will learn more about how to use git and GitHub – how to recover earlier versions, create branches and pull requests, leverage automation in GitHub Actions and much else.\n\n\nJupyterHub\nThe Project Jupyter is an open-source initiative created and led by our own Fernando Perez and collaborators around the world. JupyterHub will be our home platform for the most of our work, where we will write and run code to perform tasks. Because we are running ‘on the cloud’ – on someone else’s computer, this avoids the requirement of having to install all the necessary software used in this course on your laptop. This also means that the computational heavy-lifting is all performed by the remote computer – so we will not rely on students having powerful new laptops to complete computationally intensive tasks. This does not mean that it is necessary to use a cloud provider to do things we do. All the software we are using is free and open source and can be installed on your own computer. Indeed, it is even possible for your computer to act like it’s own data center, talking to itself over precisely the same network protocols we would use to talk to a distant machine. In this way, JupyterHub ‘abstracts’ the computational environment away from the physical hardware, making it easy to deploy a workflow on machine of the appropriate size for the task at hand – be it a tiny application or massive job for a supercomputing center.\n\nLog in to our JupyterHub, https://nature.datahub.berkeley.edu\n\nJupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Notebooks – the Jupyter ecosystem is a rich and changing landscape, which can often be confusing! A JupyterHub (such as ours, https://nature.datahub.berkeley.edu, sometimes refered to at Berkeley as a DataHub) can serve many users with individual instances of the JupyterLab (a web-based IDE), which can in turn allow a user to work with many Jupyter Notebooks (and many other file formats and interfaces, including RStudio and the open-source Visual Studio Code Server). Jupyter Notebooks are individual files (previously known as ipython notebooks, and still indicated with ipynb extension), a JSON-based serialization combining code, code outputs, and markdown text. These notebooks are used throughout the data science community in industry and academia, and can be used not only in a JupyterLab IDE but in a wide variety of IDEs that have shamelessly copied it, including Google Colab, Microsoft VSCode, and Amazon SageMaker.\n\n\nInitial setup\nAuthentication\nThere’s a few one-time setup steps we need to work with Git and GitHub from Jupyterhub. First, in order to access private repositories, we need a way for our JupyterHub instance to authenticate our identity when trying to access our private stuff on GitHub, or when trying to share (write) stuff to our GitHub account. For security purposes, we will use a token-based authentication process to authenticate with GitHub.\nTry to clone our “authentication” repo, https://github.com/espm-157-f24/auth into your Jupyterhub using the Clone Repository button from the Git menu (left side). (We will review this together in class).\n\nThen use the “File” menu on the left side to open the auth folder and then opn the Jupyter Notebook, github-login.ipynb. Try running the cell in that notebook.\n\nTada! You have authenticated with GitHub on your Jupyterhub. In future, you will only need to re-open this login notebook to authenticate, as it will remain on your JupyterHub.\nYou can now clone private repositories. Note that before you can clone a new repository, you will need to navigate your file-pane out of the current auth/ repo and back to the home directory by clicking the folder icon.\nIntroduce yourself to git\nCommits in Git are ‘signed’ to indicate who made the changes. The first time git is set up it needs to know the user’s name and email by running the following commands in a terminal. Use the “launcher” menu in Jupyter to open a new terminal and run the following commands.\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@berkeley.edu\"\nSome users perfer to use pseudonyms. The email does not have to be valid, though using the same address as you registered with GitHub will let it display your commits as comming from you. Now that git knows who you are, we are ready to start making our own commits.",

Much has changed, much will change, and this course is changing with it. Welcome aboard.\n\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course at this time. Recommended readings will be indicated when available and further developed during this course.\n\n\n\n\nLike too many UC Berkeley courses, ESPM-157 is oversubscribed. Registration for ESPM-157 follows the campus staged process with reserved seats for several of the specific majors in the host department (ESPM) as determined by Rasser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) scheduling and academic advising staff. All seats go quickly, so please plan to enroll as soon as you are eligible to do so. Students in ESPM-based majors should speak to their major adviser about enrolling in ESPM-157 and reserved seats. Please do not contact course instructors about permission to enroll or enrollment codes for reserved seats, this process is handled by RCNR Scheduling to be as fair and equitable as possible across student groups needing this course to meet graduation requirements. We are constantly exploring ways to expand access to this course without degrading the educational experience. Graduate students interested in 157 should consider ESPM 288, usually offered each Spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course centers around our in-class experience. We meet for 2 hours twice a week for a hands-on, group-based experience facilitated by your instructors. Lectures will not be recorded because there will not be lectures. Built on decades of education research and delivered in the most recent state-of-the art Active Learning Classroom on campus, this course emphasizes a collaborative learning-by-doing approach in all elements. Today, there are a wealth of lectures in data science that can be viewed freely without a university tuition. Education research shows the value of hands-on, peer based experience which we have the opportunity to create in our classroom. We recognize that things happen and students will not be penalized if they cannot make a session\nThe course is built on four open-ended modules and final project. In each, students will work in pairs (and occassionally individually) to replicate or refute the main scientific findings of a key paper or result in global change ecology. Each module is selected to introduce a core set of competencies in data science, fundamental concepts in global change ecology, and new skills for reproducible research and data-driven communication.\n\n\n\n\nThis course has no formal prerequisites.

This course is not graded “on a curve” compared to other students. Grades will reflect relative individual learning and improvement from earlier benchmarks. It is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course if all of you show mastery of the material and completely attempt all assignments. However, high competency that does not reflect learning gains or the stylistic expectations of this course may score quite poorly.

Assignments should be submitted as instructed.\n\n\n\nLate assignments may be docked 20% and will not be accepted more than 48 hours late except in cases of genuine emergencies or in cases where this has been discussed and approved in advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to use computers well, students should be working with them at multiple times each week. Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and students are expected to work on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. This policy also allows rapid feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments quickly.\n\n\n\nOur course is committed to providing a respectful and welcoming environment to all participants. Please review the Open Code of Conduct guidelines for respectful and harassment-free conduct. To report an incident or request more information, contact the UC Berkeley Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination by emailing ask_ophd@berkeley.edu or by phone (510) 643-7985.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates and your instructional team as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally. Please identify your collaborators by name on all assignments.\nSince you’re working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the course instructor informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can’t finish.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is very much a part of the modern data science landscape and will be a part of our course. This technology also raises legal, ethical and environmental issues, as technology has done before.

You do not need a fancy machine – any device with a keyboard, web browser and wifi should be sufficient to connect to our cloud-based compute platform which will be doing all the heavy lifting. If you don’t have access to a laptop please request a device through our campus STEP program.\n\n\n\nOur course aspires towards universal design principles to minimize the need for common accommodations such as extra time on written exams or recording devices for lectures (we have no timed exams and no lectures).

    "text": "Having generated a Cloud-Optimized GeoTiff (COG) file containing our NDVI calculations, we are now ready to return to our redlining data and determine if indeed we still see the legacy of those racist practices more than 50 years after they were outlawed.\nThe aggregation of raster pixels grouped by their containing polygons is something like the spatial equivalent of our .group_by() + .aggregate() operations in ibis, where the raster defines the values and the polygons define the groups.\nTo compute the average NDVI in each polygon, we will introduce yet another module – exactextract. This package can efficiently compute summary statistics for each polygon given a raster image. While several different modules can perform this kind of aggregation, exactextract is quite fast and scalable, using an efficient algorithm in C++, and gets it’s name for an ability to account for fractional coverage of a raster cell by a polygon, like so.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\nfrom exactextract import exact_extract\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\n\nWe begin as before by grabbing our remote city data.

While we have already transformed our raster data to the ‘longitude, latitude’ coordinates, EPSG:4326, we need to manually add this annotation to declare that our parquet data is already using this projection as well. We do this with .set_crs() option on geopandas object:\n\ncity =  redlines.execute().set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\")\n\n\n\n\nThe exact_extract documentation shows this is a flexible method able to take a raster and vector input and compute a range of summary statistics. The method is also somewhat flexible in how it formats the output – here we indicate we want the output formulated as a ‘geopandas’ object, keeping the geometry column and other useful columns from the original input data.\n\ncity_stats = exact_extract(\"ndvi.tif\", \n                           city, \n                           [\"mean\"], \n                           include_geom = True,\n                           include_cols=[\"label\", \"grade\", \"city\", \"fill\"],\n                           output=\"pandas\")\n\ncity_stats.head()\n\n/opt/miniforge3/lib/python3.12/site-packages/exactextract/exact_extract.py:330: RuntimeWarning: Spatial reference system of input features does not exactly match raster.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabel\ngrade\ncity\nfill\nmean\ngeometry\n\n\n\n\n0\nA1\nA\nNew Haven\n#76a865\n0.709624\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-72.9 41.36885, -72.90325 41.3...\n\n\n1\nA2\nA\nNew Haven\n#76a865\n0.761685\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-72.89401 41.36331, -72.89256 ...\n\n\n2\nA3\nA\nNew Haven\n#76a865\n0.665130\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-72.90981 41.35949, -72.90284 ...\n\n\n3\nA4\nA\nNew Haven\n#76a865\n0.751388\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-72.90284 41.35795, -72.8999 4...\n\n\n4\nA5\nA\nNew Haven\n#76a865\n0.742981\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-72.89801 41.3493, -72.89883 4...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will write out this updated file as a parquet dataset.

There are a wide range of mapping packages that have been developed for python (e.g. bokeh, kepler, folium, pydeck, lonboard, pymaplibre-gl), most of which wrap around javascript mapping libraries designed for interactive web-based maps. Just as the ibis package provides an interface to a host of different database engines that can be used as ‘backends’, leafmap wraps around most of the common mapping engines with a friendly and mostly consistent user interface. In ibis we have focused on the duckdb backend as the most powerful, flexible and performant option for all our purposes. With leafmap, we will likewise focus on the most recent and generally most powerful backend option, maplibregl - an open source implementation of the powerful and widely used commericial javascript platform, Mapbox.\n\nimport leafmap.maplibregl as leafmap\n\n::: {#fe0906fd-60f1-455e-a184-012dbf328cec .cell 0=‘h’ 1=‘i’ 2=‘d’ 3=‘e’ 4=‘-’ 5=‘o’ 6=‘u’ 7=‘t’ 8=‘p’ 9=‘u’ 10=‘t’ execution_count=19}\nm = leafmap.Map(style=\"positron\")\nm.add_gdf(city)\nm\n\n\n\n:::\nBecause our map is an interactive javascript applet, putting m at the end of the a cell will allow it to display inline in Jupyter, but not in ‘static’ documentation such as the course website or a GitHub rendering of the notebook.

This allows any web browser to view and interact with the map without having to install jupyter or python.\n\nm.to_html(\"../data/nh1.html\", overwrite=True)\n\n::: {#8a433141-72bd-4b8c-8e46-ed4c86aeb12d .cell 0=‘h’ 1=‘i’ 2=‘d’ 3=‘e’ 4=‘-’ 5=‘i’ 6=‘n’ 7=‘p’ 8=‘u’ 9=‘t’ scrolled=‘true’ execution_count=21}\n# display map on course website by using an iframe to the output URL \nIFrame(src='https://espm-157.github.io/static-maps/nh1.html', width=700, height=400)\n\n\n        \n        \n\n:::\nrendered map fullscreen\n\n\nLeafmap allows us to add many layers to our map from various data sources, and gives us a rich set of tools for styling the look and feel of most of those data layers. The example below illustrates some more complex patterns for generating a rich map.\n\nWe introduce a basemap with add_basemap(). This is just a background image, that is tiled to re-draw to the appropriate zoom and window. However, note that basemaps are just background images, we cannot extract actual data from these sources.\nWe have added source data by pointing to a remote URL. This provides much better performance than embedding the JSON data directly, especially when the data become very large. This requires the data is hosted at a highly available provider, such as GitHub or another cloud service. The original host source won’t work unfortunately.\n\nWe have used a custom filter inside the source data to select our city of interest. This could be omitted.\nWe have colored our polygons according to grade given in the data. Specifically, we noticed that the column “fill” already contains color codes in HEX format corresponding to the redlining “grade” associated with each layer.\nWe have added a final layer of text labels based on the “label” column.\n\n\nimport json\ngeojson = json.loads(city.to_json())\n\n\nm = leafmap.Map(center=[-72.9, 41.3], zoom=12)\n\nsource = {\n    \"type\": \"geojson\", \n#    'data':

    "text": "Leafmap allows us to add many layers to our map from various data sources, and gives us a rich set of tools for styling the look and feel of most of those data layers. The example below illustrates some more complex patterns for generating a rich map.\n\nWe introduce a basemap with add_basemap(). This is just a background image, that is tiled to re-draw to the appropriate zoom and window. However, note that basemaps are just background images, we cannot extract actual data from these sources.\nWe have added source data by pointing to a remote URL. This provides much better performance than embedding the JSON data directly, especially when the data become very large. This requires the data is hosted at a highly available provider, such as GitHub or another cloud service. The original host source won’t work unfortunately.\n\nWe have used a custom filter inside the source data to select our city of interest. This could be omitted.\nWe have colored our polygons according to grade given in the data. Specifically, we noticed that the column “fill” already contains color codes in HEX format corresponding to the redlining “grade” associated with each layer.\nWe have added a final layer of text

This will obviously impact our assessment of whether or not the species as a whole has collapsed. This is too many stocks to easily explore, let’s try breaking this out by at the by country:\n\n(\n    so.Plot(cod_stocks, \n            x = \"tsyear\", \n            y=\"catch\", \n            color = \"stockid\",\n            group = \"primary_country\")\n    .add(so.Lines(linewidth=3))\n    .facet(\"primary_country\", wrap = 6)\n    .layout(size=(16, 10))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote in the country-based graphs, several countries have multiple stocks. Norway and Canada stand out for the largest harvests. The ‘grammar of graphics’ in Seaborn objects makes it easy to quickly visually explore the data along different dimensions. For instance, we can divide stocks by primary FAO Area instead of country with a single change:\n\n(\n    so.Plot(cod_stocks, \n            x = \"tsyear\", \n            y=\"catch\", \n            color = \"stockid\",\n            group = \"primary_FAOarea\")\n    .add(so.Lines(linewidth=3))\n    .facet(\"primary_FAOarea\")\n    .layout(size=(12, 8))\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have visually grouped the data into the two parts of the globe where Atlantic Cod are found: “Western North-Atlantic” (FAO area 21) and “Eastern North-Atlantic” (area 27). While we see declines in some Eastern stocks, the pattern in the West is much more dramatic. If we want to consider the fate of Western Atlantic Cod as a whole, we can add up all these individual stocks to get a picture for the entire FAO Region. We call the resulting table cod_fao because now it no longer reflects individual stocks, we have summed all the individual stocks up when we aggregated to the level of entire FAO regions.\n\ncod_fao = (cod_stocks\n   .group_by(_.tsyear, _.primary_FAOarea)\n   .agg(catch = _.catch.sum())\n)\n\n\nOnce again we can get a visual sense of the resulting aggrecations.  \n\n\n(\n    so.Plot(cod_fao, \n            x = \"tsyear\", \n            y=\"catch\")\n    .add(so.Lines(linewidth=3))\n    .facet(\"primary_FAOarea\")\n)",

    "text": "ibis Table Joins\n\nLearning Goals\n\nuse join() to combine two tables on a key column\n\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\nimport ibis.selectors as s\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nLast time we started getting comfortable with lazy evaluation (head() and execute()) in ibis, and began to learn how to select() (subset columns) and filter() (subset rows), as well as looking at distinct values. Today we will continue to draw on these skills as we go deeper into the fisheries data in search of the evidence of the North Atlantic Cod collapse. In the process, we shall pick up some new methods as well.\nAs before, let’s start with reading in data. Rather than focus on the metrics table, this time we will connect to several tables at the same time. Note how we can reuse the base_url to avoid extra typing, but take care that we reading the right CSV file in each case! As before, we explicitly set the nullstr value as well to ensure missing value codes are correctly interpreted.\n\nbase_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/cboettig/ram_fisheries/resolve/main/v4.65/\"\n\nstock = con.read_csv(base_url + \"stock.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\ntimeseries = con.read_csv(base_url + \"timeseries.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\nassessment = con.read_csv(base_url + \"assessment.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\n\n\n\nFish ‘stocks’\nLike most real world data science problems, understanding these tables requires both a bit of background in fisheries science and a lot of splunking into the data. For our purposes, one of the key things you should know is that fisheries are divided into “stocks”, which you can think of as a particular species of fish in a particular area of the ocean. Let’s use the stock table to explore this idea a bit more. Let’s begin with a peek at the stock table:\n\nstock\n\nDatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_5sjnrevlzzaijnrmxgnnonpheq\n  stockid         string\n  tsn             int64\n  scientificname  string\n  commonname      string\n  areaid          string\n  stocklong       string\n  region          string\n  primary_country string\n  primary_FAOarea int64\n  ISO3_code       string\n  GRSF_uuid       string\n  GRSF_areaid     string\n  inmyersdb       int64\n  myersstockid    string\n  state           string\n\n\n\nAh! commonname looks like a good place as any to go looking for Atlantic cod. Of course if we knew (or looked up) the scientific name of the species, that might be even better – after all, common names are not always as precise. Let’s see what we can find:\n\n(stock\n .filter(_.commonname == \"Atlantic cod\")\n .select(_.stockid, _.scientificname, _.commonname, \n         _.areaid, _.region, _.primary_country, _.ISO3_code)\n .head()\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstockid\nscientificname\ncommonname\nareaid\nregion\nprimary_country\nISO3_code\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOD1ABCDE\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1ABCDE\nCanada East Coast\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n1\nCOD1F-XIV\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1F-XIV\nEurope non EU\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n2\nCOD1IN\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1IN\nCanada East Coast\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n3\nCOD2J3KL\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nCanada-DFO-2J3KL\nCanada East Coast\nCanada\nCAN\n\n\n4\nCOD3M\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-NAFO-3M\nCanada East Coast\nPortugal\nPRT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of stocks of Atlantic cod! Each row begins with a unique stockid. A column that uniquely identifies each row in a given table is often referred to as the “primary key” for that table (and is often but not necessarily listed first). The rows that follow give us some sense of what defines a “stock” as a species in an area: we see a few different identifiers for the species: commonname, scientificname. We also see information abot the area the stock occurs in – such as areaid, region, and primary country. (For display purposes we selected only a subset of columns).\nWhile we have found the Cod, we haven’t yet found any data about the cod catch over time! For that we will need to look in the timeseries data. Let’s see how it is organized:\n\ntimeseries.head().execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassessid\nstockid\nstocklong\ntsid\ntsyear\ntsvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1960\nNaN\n\n\n1\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1961\nNaN\n\n\n2\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1962\nNaN\n\n\n3\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1963\nNaN\n\n\n4\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1964\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe again have a column called stockid. While we no longer have columns such as commonname or scientificname to tell us what species each row in the timeseries is measuring, we now know that we can look up that information in the stock table using the stockid. Such a column is often called a “foreign key”, because it matches the primary key of a separate table. (it appears the timeseries data has no ‘primary key’ of it’s own – no column that has a unique value for each row.). Rather than have to switch back and forth between two tables, we can join the two tables on stockid:\n\n(stock\n .filter(_.commonname == \"Atlantic cod\")\n .join(timeseries, \"stockid\")\n .head()\n .select(_.stockid, _.scientificname, _.tsid, _.tsyear, \n         _.tsvalue, _.stocklong, _.stocklong_right) # subset of columns to keep display narrow\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstockid\nscientificname\ntsid\ntsyear\ntsvalue\nstocklong\nstocklong_right\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1958\n0.997804\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n1\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1959\n1.706091\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n2\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1960\n1.308003\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n3\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1961\n1.713846\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n4\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1962\n1.685411\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectively all this has done is take our timeseries table and for each stockid, add extra columns explaining what the stock table tells us about the stockid - species names, areas, and so on. The join has made our data is much wider than before – we have all the columns from both tables. (Note that both tables happened to have one column with the same name, stocklong. A truly tidy database would not have done this – we can easily see that this information belongs in the stock table. Because our database cannot assume these are the same when we join, it has renamed the one on the “right” (from timeseries) as “stocklong_right” to distinguish them). Because each stockid was repeated in the timeseries table, now all this other information is repeated too. This is not as inefficient as it may sound, thanks to internal optimizations in the database.\nWhile it is clear even from this head() preview that we have the columns from both tables, what about the rows? Our stock table was already filtered to a subset of rows containing only Cod stocks. This join (technically called an “inner join”) has kept only those stockids, so we now have timeseries only about Cod! In fact, we could have instead joined the full tables for all stock ids, and then applied the filter for commonname.\n\n\nExercise\nTry further exploring this resulting table using select() and distinct() to get a better sense of what rows are here. You will notice additional “*id” columns, like asssesid or areaid matching other tables in the data. Explore filtering and joinging with these tables as well.",

    "text": "Analysis-ready data, or ‘tidy data’, is a central concept in data science. The term was coined by Hadley Wickham1 to describe best practices long known in the relational database community, specifically, conventions around formatting tabular data known as Cobb’s Third Normal Form. In this form, each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable. These conventions allow us to leverage powerful software and techniques for data analysis and visualization more easily, as many such tools are designed with tidy data structures in mind. However, wild-caught data often does not follow these rules. Consider this example of NASA data on land ice mass:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/499_GRN_ANT_mass_changes.csv\",\n                skiprows=10, names=['date', 'greenland', 'antarctica'])\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\ngreenland\nantarctica\n\n\n\n\n0\n2002.29\n1490.68\n967.20\n\n\n1\n2002.35\n1485.69\n978.55\n\n\n2\n2002.62\n1286.84\n512.02\n\n\n3\n2002.71\n1257.85\n858.85\n\n\n4\n2002.79\n1257.17\n693.87\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n135\n2014.45\n-1672.08\n-1021.70\n\n\n136\n2014.62\n-1985.59\n-1067.84\n\n\n137\n2014.71\n-2024.82\n-780.87\n\n\n138\n2014.79\n-1973.96\n-904.38\n\n\n139\n2014.88\n-1911.78\n-1009.80\n\n\n\n\n140 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nThe column heading we have called ‘greenland’ is not a single variable (feature) being observed, but in fact a mashup of two different variables – the ice mass (in gigatons) on the location of Greenland. (In the original data file it has the name Greenland mass (Gt), which more clearly indicates this mash-up but does not follow our naming conventions. Likewise the column called ‘antarctica’ again measures land ice mass, but at a different location. A “tidy” version of this data would use one column to indicate location (Greenland or Antarctica) and another column to indicate ice mass at that location.\nTo fix this, we need to pivot the data table into a “long” form, with a single column for ice mass and a single column for location. While there are many ways to do this, we will rely on the ibis framework which provides one of the most consistent and powerful interfaces for tabular data operations. We begin by loading the ibis library and establishing a “connection” to a backend engine.\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import selectors as s\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nWe add our pandas table to the ibis connection using the method create_table. This allows us to manipulate the table using ibis methods rather than pandas. We will later see other ways to create ibis tables directly from a wide range of data other than pandas data.frames.\nWe then use the pivot_longer() method to transform our data. We use the ibis.selectors methods to indicate which columns we are aggregating in the pivot. Optionally, we indicate the name of the new column that will contain the previous column names (greenland, antarctica) and the name of the column that will contain the cell values (the ice mass).\n\nland_ice = (con\n .create_table(\"land_ice\", df, overwrite=True)\n .pivot_longer(s.any_of('greenland', 'antarctica'),\n               names_to= \"location\", values_to = \"ice_mass\")\n)\n\nland_ice.execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nlocation\nice_mass\n\n\n\n\n0\n2002.29\ngreenland\n1490.68\n\n\n1\n2002.29\nantarctica\n967.20\n\n\n2\n2002.35\ngreenland\n1485.69\n\n\n3\n2002.35\nantarctica\n978.55\n\n\n4\n2002.62\ngreenland\n1286.84\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n275\n2014.71\nantarctica\n-780.87\n\n\n276\n2014.79\ngreenland\n-1973.96\n\n\n277\n2014.79\nantarctica\n-904.38\n\n\n278\n2014.88\ngreenland\n-1911.78\n\n\n279\n2014.88\nantarctica\n-1009.80\n\n\n\n\n280 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nNote the use of .execute() at the end of the ibis command to see the results. ibis uses a sophisticated strategy called “lazy evaluation”, in which it does not actually run the code we provide until absolutely necessary. While this feels cumbersome now, these small extra steps will pay big dividends for us when we move to big data sources that historically courses have needed to teach entirely different tools for.\nNow that are data is ‘tidy’, some operations are much easier. For instance, plotting two lines, with a legend, merely requires the single aesthetic mapping of color to the location column: color = \"location\"\n\nimport seaborn.objects as so\np = (so.Plot(land_ice, \n             x = \"date\", \n             y = \"ice_mass\", \n             color = \"location\")\n     .add(so.Line())\n    )\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can map this additional column to different aesthetics just as easily. This illustrates the value of well-structured data and abstract grammar for operating on it. For instance, having subplots (facets) based on this data:\n\np.facet(\"location\")",

Extensive education research has underscored the value in starting with visualization. Visualization offers ‘early wins’, producing something that is compelling and often fun. Like many of our skills, we will continue to refine and extend our knowledge of data visualization throughout each stage of the course, Mastery comes through repetition.\n\n\nThe seaborn Object Interface implements the Grammar of Graphics in python. This approach to data visualization provides a powerful abstraction around data visualization concepts. The theory has been around for a long time, but has become mainstream in data science through the work of Hadley Wickham and ggplot2 implementation in R. Python libraries have only begun to adopt this concept more recently, but it can now be found in many python visualization libraries, including plotnine, altair, and seaborn’s object interface.[^1]\n[1]: Choosing packages is an important but tricky question. Many academic courses pretend to dismiss the issue, arguing that if students learn the fundamental principles, they will always be able to use the whatever package is fashionable at the time. There is some truth to this, but ignores obvious realities in the learning experience.

For instance, different colors are often used in graphs to indicate different groups:\n\nimport ibis\ndf = ibis.read_csv(\"../data/co2.csv\")\ndf.to_pandas()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecimal_date\nname\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\n1958.2027\nco2\n315.71\n\n\n1\n1958.2027\nsmooth\n314.44\n\n\n2\n1958.2877\nco2\n317.45\n\n\n3\n1958.2877\nsmooth\n315.16\n\n\n4\n1958.3699\nco2\n317.51\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1589\n2024.3750\nsmooth\n423.61\n\n\n1590\n2024.4583\nco2\n426.91\n\n\n1591\n2024.4583\nsmooth\n424.44\n\n\n1592\n2024.5417\nco2\n425.55\n\n\n1593\n2024.5417\nsmooth\n425.10\n\n\n\n\n1594 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nThe grammar of graphics always maps data (i.e. columns) to abstract aesthetics.

Learning the grammar makes it much easier to make and modify complex charts, while also encouraging best-practices such as tidy data and semantic code. Contrast this code with an alternative syntax that specifies the color manually:\n\n# Example of older verbose code\nimport seaborn as sns\ndf1 = df.pivot_wider()\nsns.lineplot(df1, x=\"decimal_date\", y = \"co2\", color=\"blue\")\nsns.lineplot(df1, x=\"decimal_date\", y = \"smooth\", color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this syntax, x and y still refer to columns of the data, but color is asserted manually. The relationship between color and data structure is not captured here. If we wanted to use a different color scheme, we would have to manually update each assertion. This is harder to generalize and more error-prone. Note also that while this approach is somewhat more concise for a single x/y line, it quickly becomes more verbose, repeating many parts that do not need repeating in the previous approach. We will avoid this older syntax.\nIn this example we can spot other advantages as well, such as default color theme informed by visualization research, and syntax that encourages the use of “tidy” data, in which columns represent variables and rows represent observations.

    "text": "We will be focusing on how to use the ibis package, a successor to the popular pandas package, for manipulating tabular data. We begin by importing the ibis package. (We include two additional imports from the package which are commonly referred to using their short names, the table placeholder _ instead of ibis._, and the selectors methods as s instead of the verbose ibis.selectors. We will see these in action later).\n\nLearning Goals\n\nestablish a connection with duckdb.connect()\nuse head() and excute() to preview large data\nuse select(), distinct(), filter() to explore data.\n\n\n\nGetting started\nTo use ibis, we must also select a backend. We will always be using the quite new and very powerful duckdb backend for all of our tasks. We select a backend by creating a “connection”. The details here are not important for us, we can treat this first block as “boilerplate” starting code.\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\nimport ibis.selectors as s\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nWe are now ready to read in our data. We will begin by reading the metrics table from the direct access link, as indicated in the URL below. con.read_csv() is quite similar to the pandas.read_csv() we saw in module 1, though the optional arguments get some different names and are not quite as flexibile. One important option for our purposes will be the how to indicate missing values. In the past, we’ve seen negative values like -99 be used to indicate missing values. That convention reflects limitations of early software, which had no natural concept of “missing”. More modern conventions indicating missing values as “NULL” or “NA”. We indicate the data has chosen the latter:\n\nmetrics_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/cboettig/ram_fisheries/resolve/main/v4.65/tsmetrics.csv\"\ntsmetrics = con.read_csv(metrics_url, nullstr=\"NA\")\n\n\n\nPreviewing data: head() and execute()\nLet’s take a look at our new table:\n\ntsmetrics\n\nDatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_lnkh36a47bbdhi4vbfj7tetgry\n  tscategory   string\n  tsshort      string\n  tslong       string\n  tsunitsshort string\n  tsunitslong  string\n  tsunique     string\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t look like a pretty pandas table! Where are the values? Actually, as we become more familiar with ibis we learn to appreciate the display choice here. ibis is designed for working with very big data. An important part of this is something called lazy evaluation. Even downloading a very large fle might take a long time, and trying to load a large dataset into python all at once can exceed available RAM and crash the kernel. Instead, ibis merely “peeks” at the data over the remote connection – without even downloading it! It tells us the names of each column and the data type (e.g. string, or numeric, etc) that the read_csv method has ‘guessed’ for the data. As we will see, this is often the most useful information anway.\nIf we we do want to see a few example rows, we can use the method head() on the table, tsmetrics.head(), to say we want only want to see the top of the data frame. Optionally we can specify how many rows we want to preview, e.g. tsmetrics.head(10) to see 10 (the default is 5). Let’s try it:\n\ntsmetrics.head()\n\nr0 := DatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_lnkh36a47bbdhi4vbfj7tetgry\n  tscategory   string\n  tsshort      string\n  tslong       string\n  tsunitsshort string\n  tsunitslong  string\n  tsunique     string\n\nLimit[r0, n=5]\n\n\n\nThat’s not the top of 5 rows! Once again, ibis is being lazy. We see the same definition of the table as before, only this time it has a name r0, and we see a “plan of execution”, that ibis will return the first 5 rows Limit[r0, 5]. We can force it to execute this plan with execute() :\n\ntsmetrics.head().execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\ntsshort\ntslong\ntsunitsshort\ntsunitslong\ntsunique\n\n\n\n\n0\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\nAQ\nAquaculture\nMT\nmetric tons\nAQ-MT\n\n\n1\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\nASP\nAnnual surplus production\nMT\nMetric tons\nASP-MT\n\n\n2\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmgtpref\nGeneral biomass time series preferentially rel...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmgtpref-dimensionless\n\n\n3\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmgttouse\nGeneral biomass time series relative to manage...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmgttouse-dimensionless\n\n\n4\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmsypref\nGeneral biomass time series preferentially rel...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmsypref-dimensionless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last, we are starting to see what the data really looks like. Data tables can quickly become much to large to explore by simply trying to eyeball every row. For instance, we notice the first column, tscategory, shows a few different possible categories for the various metrics in the database. So, how many distinct categories are there?\n\n\nselect() and distinct()\nTo answer this, we will introduce a few more methods of data table manipulation. select() selects one or more columns of a given table, while distinct() returns only distinct (unique) rows of the table. Note that both of these methods share a common pattern – they both apply to a table (not some piece of a table, like a row or column or cell), and they both return a new table as well that is some subset of the old table. table in, table out. This design is very intentional – by having methods designed specificially to operate on tables and return tables, we can easily stack or chain these together, (also true of head() and execute()`. So let’s try and see distinct categories:\n\n(tsmetrics\n .select(\"tscategory\")\n .distinct()\n .head(10)\n .execute()\n)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\n\n\n\n\n0\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\n\n\n1\nSPAWNING STOCK BIOMASS or CPUE\n\n\n2\nPRODUCTION\n\n\n3\nTOTAL BIOMASS\n\n\n4\nRECRUITS (NOTE: RECRUITS ARE OFFSET IN TIME SE...\n\n\n5\nTIME UNITS\n\n\n6\nCATCH or LANDINGS\n\n\n7\nFISHING MORTALITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have stacked these methods together with each step on it’s own line by wrapping the whole thing inside () parentheses. This can make a long “chain” of commands easier to read. While we have asked for no more that 10 values, we have gotten back only 8 – so we now know there are only 8 categories.\n\n\nfilter()\nWhat are the different unit types within, say, the “CATCH or LANDINGS” category? This requires a subset of rows (a filter), rather than a subset of columns (select()):\n\n(tsmetrics\n .filter(_.tscategory == \"CATCH or LANDINGS\")\n .distinct()\n .head(14)\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\ntsshort\ntslong\ntsunitsshort\ntsunitslong\ntsunique\n\n\n\n\n0\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nCdivMSY-conv\nCatch divided by MSY calculated from converted...\nratio\nratio\nCdivMSY-conv-ratio\n\n\n1\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nCdivMSY\nCatch divided by MSY\nratio\nratio\nCdivMSY-ratio\n\n\n2\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nTAC-A2\nTotal allowable catch In subarea\nMT\nMetric tons\nTAC-A2-MT\n\n\n3\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nTC-3\nTotal catch.

This is actually a shorthand for the pattern tsmetrics.tscategory – the _ is a placeholder for “the current table” in our chain. Extracting a single column with . is itself something of a shorthand, it is equivalent to using the selector [, as tsmetrics[\"category\"]. When a column name is also the name of a table method, we may need to fall back on the square bracket convention. So why use a dot at all? In addition to taking two less characters to write, the . method allows “tab completion” of the column name, which helps us avoid typos. Note that our select() method recognizes either syntax, you can do: tsmetrics.select(_.tscategory). This looks slightly more cryptic, but benefits from autocomplete and matches the sytnax of other functions.\n\n\n== not =\nAnother common mistake is to use a single = sign rather than == in filter. Recall that = is used in variable assignment, a = 1 sets the value of a as 1. Double-equals is a “boolean operator”, that tests if the statement is True or False:\n\na = 1\na == 1\n\nTrue\n\n\nOther boolean operators include &gt;, &gt;=, != (not equal) and so forth. The important thing is to know that we can do boolean comparisons, this syntax is easy to look up.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nExplore the datasets in this collection using select(), distinct() and filter(). We will return to this list of Catch units after we become more aquainted with the remaining tables.\nThis syntax is harder than select() – we can’t just filter for “CATCH or LANDINGS” without indicating which column we are looking in. To signal that tscategory is a column name and not just a piece of text, we use the subsetting notation, _.tscategory. This is merely a shorthand for the more verbose:",

    "text": "In this section, we will explore various spatial data formats, operations, and visualization methods. As before, there is large landscape of tools and platforms designed to work for spatial data. We will be focusing on a subset of tools now emerging at the leading edge of cloud-native geospatial computing.\nGeospatial computation can be divided into three components:\n\nData I/O (input/output)\nData manipulation / analysis\nData visualization\n\n\n\nWe divide geospatial data1 into two broad classes of data:\n\nraster data\nvector data\n\nRaster data, also called “image” data or gridded data are made up of pixels. Vector data is made out of spatial coordinates expressing shapes as points, lines, or polygons.\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\n\n\nAs with tabular data, our first task is to read our data object from a file into python. Spatial vector data can be found in a bewildering array of formats or file types (or “serializations”). Because some common platforms can only understand a few of these formats, it is not uncommon to see spatial data providers offer the same data in multile formats. Fortunately for us can more-or-less all be read in the same way.\nJust as pandas has historically been the go-to for reading in tabular data, geopandas is the most common mechanism for reading spatial data into python. Built on top of pandas, it faces the same limitations, especially when it comes to very big geospatial data. Rather than teaching you different tools to work with ‘small’ and ‘big’ data, thanks to recent innovations we will be able to start off learning the faster, more scalable ‘big data’ solutions provided by duckdb and accessible to us in ibis.\nLet’s begin by looking at the redlining data from the Mapping Inequality Project, https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data. This data provider offers the ability to “download” the data in either format. ibis 2 can read either one, and can do so both directly from the URL and without downloading the entire file. Use a two-finger click on the download button to copy-paste the download URL into your notebook, like so:\n\n%%time\nredlines = con.read_geo(\"/vsicurl/https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n\nCPU times: user 542 ms, sys: 110 ms, total: 653 ms\nWall time: 1.67 s\n\n\nNote how we have added the prefix /vsicurl/ in the URL. This signifies to the underlying software (GDAL) that we wish to use the virtual system interface to access this url, i.e. rather than first copying the file to the local machine, we access just the bytes we need over ‘range requests’. Previously we have seen ibis do this ‘range request’ trick automatically on URLs for text-based data, and in future this explicit prefix may not be necessary here either.\n\n#%%time\n#without_vsi = con.read_geo(\"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n\nWe can now use our ibis functions to explore this data.

Unlike computer graphics formats which typically represent images in a ‘flat’ (Euclidian) geometry, geospatial data must contend with the curvature of the earth using an explicit notion of coordinate reference systems. We will have more to say about this later.↩︎\nGood abstractions are at the core of good software design. ibis isn’t really doing the heavy lifting here, it is merely providing a user-friendly ‘pythonic’ interface to many different “backends” that perform the actual computation. Only one of those, duckdb, is providing the spatial abilities we need. When it comes to reading different file formats, duckdb achieves this only by calling out to another piece of software, GDAL, which has been around a lot longer and can be found under the hood of a great many geospatial data tools, from python packages like geopandas to QGIS to Google Earth Engine.↩︎\nsome additional methods are possible in the underlying duckdb spatial extension but do not yet have bindings in ibis. ibis provides an extension syntax that allows users to invoke these methods.↩︎",

    "text": "In this section we turn to raster data, specifically, to satellite imagery. To get started, we must select an “area of interest” where we want to study – in our case, the bounding box around the redlining polygons of whichever city we have chosen. Given a geopandas data frame of our city, we can extract the bounding box in using the .total_bounds() method1\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect(extensions=[\"spatial\"])\n\nredlines = (\n    con\n    .read_geo(\"/vsicurl/https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n    .filter(_.city == \"New Haven\", _.residential)\n   )\ncity =  redlines.execute()\nbox = city.total_bounds\nbox\n\n\n\n\narray([-72.99321,  41.23109, -72.85227,  41.37502])\n\n\n\n\nWorking with raster data will take us beyond the tabular data model we have been using so far with ibis into another data model, known in some communities as “raster” data and others as “M-dimensional array data”. Consequently, we will be introducing a suite of new packages for working with kind of data. To help associate the different new python packages with there roles in this data pipeline, I will be adding the import commands as we go along, rather than all at once.\nWe begin by searching for relevant satellite imagery using a Spatio-Temporal Assets Catalog (STAC). A STAC catalog lets us search for all data in a particular collection that corresponds to a certain place and time, and potentionally other criteria noted in the catalog description. The python module pystac_client can automate this search process for us. Here, we search for all data assets in the “Sentinel-2 Level 2a” catalogue of publicly hosted data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which:\n\nfalls within our bounding box\noccurs in the most recent summer months (we want to measure greenness when leaves are on the trees)\nhas less than 20% of the image obscured by clouds\n\nAt this stage, we are only reading the STAC data catalog using pystac_client, not touching any of the actual data files. Our goal is to narrow down to the URLs of just those assets we need, rather than downloading lots of data that won’t end up in our analysis. This approach is a core element of a ‘cloud native’ workflow.\n\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n\n\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2024-06-01/2024-09-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\nLet’s take a look at what

“features”, each corresponding to a different time the satellite has flown over and taken an image of our bounding box during the window described. Our search criteria have also excluded any images taken during that interval that have more than 20% cloud cover. You may need to adjust the cloud cover filter or the date range to recover a handful of images. We need at least one, but preferably a few different images to get an accurate estimate of the greenness during summer months. Too many images, however, can just bog things down with exta calculations. If you have more than 4 or 5 images, consider a stricter cloud requirement or a narrower date range to filter down your results.\nClick on the arrows above to drill down into the list of features returned like so:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nWithin each “feature” we find detailed metadata about the data contained. The spatial extent of the image appears in the “geometry”, while date and other information appear under “properties” In the “assets” element, we finally find a list of all the individual data files associated with this feature – primarily specific “bands” or wavelengths of light that the cameras on board the satellite are able to detect. While cameras in smart-phones (and most small commericial cube-sats) can only see Red, Green, and Blue, the sensors on board Sentinel-2 can see in quite a lot more wavelengths. A URL points to the specific TIF file containing the data for each wavelength.\n\n\n\nRather than work our way though all this metadata manually, we will now draw upon another package that is capable of understanding the information returned by the STAC catalog and helping us access only the parts we need, without downloading entire assets. Historically this kind of trick was only done with specialized systems and powerful computers such as Google Earth Engine. Today, open source tools in python make many of the same operations possible with greater flexibility and control. This approach is fundamental to scalable ‘cloud-native’ analysis of massive satellite data.\nOur next step uses a package called odc.stac to load just the two spectral bands of interest for us, and access only those parts of each file that correspond to our area of interest. We will only scratch the surface of odc.stac tooling here, but more details can be found in the odc.stac documentation.\n\nimport odc.stac\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    bbox=box,\n    resolution=10, # the native resolution is already 10m.

For large city areas like Los Angeles that need multiple images to tile, consider reducing this resolution, e.g. to 100m, to improve overall performance. Using chunking (chunks={}) and grouping (e.g. groupby=\"solar_day\") also help scaling to larger image collections by breaking the processing into smaller steps.\n\n\n\nThe most common metric of “greeness” (i.e. vegetation cover) for satellite imagery is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI (see link for details). Plants are green because they obsorb red light, while reflecting near-infrared. NDVI compares the difference between these two band intensities to the sum:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED} \\]\nThis creates a ‘normalized’ index that should be between -1 (water) and 1 (maximum vegitation). xarray makes it easy to compute operations on different bands (variables), e.g. we can compute the difference between each \\((X, Y, Time)\\) coordinate in the NIR wavelength to thhat of the red wavelength as data.nir08 - data.red. We can also compute summary statistics across dimensions. Here, becuase we have 4 different timepoints, we will take the median measurement over time – a common summary statistic that is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Lastly, we will drop any “bad” pixels, where the NDVI value is greater than 1.\n\nndvi = (\n    ((data.nir08 - data.red) / (data.red + data.nir08))\n    .median(\"time\", keep_attrs=True)\n)\n\nndvi = ndvi.where(ndvi &lt; 1).compute()\n\n\nndvi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray (y: 1627, x: 1220)&gt; Size: 16MB\narray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 13kB 4.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06 4.566e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 10kB 6.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05 6.8e+05\n    spatial_ref  int32 4B 32618xarray.DataArrayy: 1627x: 12200.8859 0.8805 0.8716 0.9001 0.8955 0.9044 ... nan nan nan nan nan nanarray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])Coordinates: (3)y(y)float644.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06units :metreresolution :-10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([4582615., 4582605., 4582595., ..., 4566375., 4566365., 4566355.])x(x)float646.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05units :metreresolution :10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([667815., 667825., 667835., ..., 679985., 679995., 680005.])spatial_ref()int3232618spatial_ref :PROJCRS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N\",BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],ID[\"EPSG\",4326]],CONVERSION[\"UTM zone 18N\",METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",-75,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",0.9996,SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],PARAMETER[\"False easting\",500000,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],PARAMETER[\"False northing\",0,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],CS[Cartesian,2],AXIS[\"(E)\",east,ORDER[1],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],AXIS[\"(N)\",north,ORDER[2],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],USAGE[SCOPE[\"Navigation and medium accuracy spatial referencing.\"],AREA[\"Between 78°W and 72°W, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

While it is possible to construct reasonably nice static map images with sufficient effort in this way, that approach is neither as user-friendly or as powerful as the more general interactive (javascript-based) maps generated by leafmap, so we won’t worry too much about styling. However, .plot.imshow() can be a convenient way to check what an xarray dataset looks like during the analysis process.\n\nndvi.plot.imshow()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize our dervied data on an interactive map or share it with other researchers, we need to be able to export it to a file. One of the best choices for this purpose is a format referred to as “Cloud Optimized GeoTiff”, or “COG” for short. A COG file embeds multiple “zooms” and internal tiles, allowing it be rendered rapidly in visualizations. COG data files still preserve the numerical values of each pixel and associated metadata, making them useful for further computations. We will take advantage of this latter feature in seeking to summarize the average greeness in each polygon in our redlining data. The rioxarray package provides convenient utilities for input and output (io) between raster files and xarray data structures in python.\n\nimport rioxarray\n(ndvi\n .rio.reproject(\"EPSG:4326\")\n .rio.to_raster(raster_path=\"ndvi.tif\", \n                driver=\"COG\")   \n)\n\nSide note: optionally, we can also store a copy of our vector data, also setting the projection. Common formats include geopackage, .gpkg, and .parquet.\n\n(city\n .set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\")\n .to_file(\"new_haven.gpkg\") # common open standard\n)\n\n\n# latest option, best performance but less widely known:\ncity.set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\").to_parquet(\"new_haven.parquet\")",

    "text": "Working with raster data will take us beyond the tabular data model we have been using so far with ibis into another data model, known in some communities as “raster” data and others as “M-dimensional array data”. Consequently, we will be introducing a suite of new packages for working with kind of data. To help associate the different new python packages with there roles in this data pipeline, I will be adding the import commands as we go along, rather than all at once.\nWe begin by searching for relevant satellite imagery using a Spatio-Temporal Assets Catalog (STAC). A STAC catalog lets us search for all data in a particular collection that corresponds to a certain place and time, and potentionally other criteria noted in the catalog description. The python module pystac_client can automate this search process for us. Here, we search for all data assets in the “Sentinel-2 Level 2a” catalogue of publicly hosted data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which:\n\nfalls within our bounding box\noccurs in the most recent summer months (we want to measure greenness when leaves are on the trees)\nhas less than 20% of the image obscured by clouds\n\nAt this stage, we are only reading the STAC data catalog using pystac_client, not touching any of the actual data files. Our goal is to narrow down to the URLs of just those assets we need, rather than downloading lots of data that won’t end up in our analysis. This approach is a core element of a ‘cloud native’ workflow.\n\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n\n\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2024-06-01/2024-09-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\nLet’s take a look at what

“features”, each corresponding to a different time the satellite has flown over and taken an image of our bounding box during the window described. Our search criteria have also excluded any images taken during that interval that have more than 20% cloud cover. You may need to adjust the cloud cover filter or the date range to recover a handful of images. We need at least one, but preferably a few different images to get an accurate estimate of the greenness during summer months. Too many images, however, can just bog things down with exta calculations. If you have more than 4 or 5 images, consider a stricter cloud requirement or a narrower date range to filter down your results.\nClick on the arrows above to drill down into the list of features returned like so:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nWithin each “feature” we find detailed metadata about the data contained. The spatial extent of the image appears in the “geometry”, while date and other information appear under “properties” In the “assets” element, we finally find a list of all the individual data files associated with this feature – primarily specific “bands” or wavelengths of light that the cameras on board the satellite are able to detect. While cameras in smart-phones (and most small commericial cube-sats) can only see Red, Green, and Blue, the sensors on board Sentinel-2 can see in quite a lot more wavelengths. A URL points to the specific TIF file containing the data for each wavelength.",

    "text": "Rather than work our way though all this metadata manually, we will now draw upon another package that is capable of understanding the information returned by the STAC catalog and helping us access only the parts we need, without downloading entire assets. Historically this kind of trick was only done with specialized systems and powerful computers such as Google Earth Engine. Today, open source tools in python make many of the same operations possible with greater flexibility and control. This approach is fundamental to scalable ‘cloud-native’ analysis of massive satellite data.\nOur next step uses a package called odc.stac to load just the two spectral bands of interest for us, and access only those parts of each file that correspond to our area of interest. We will only scratch the surface of odc.stac tooling here, but more details can be found in the odc.stac documentation.\n\nimport odc.stac\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    bbox=box,\n    resolution=10, # the native resolution is already 10m.

    "text": "The most common metric of “greeness” (i.e. vegetation cover) for satellite imagery is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI (see link for details). Plants are green because they obsorb red light, while reflecting near-infrared. NDVI compares the difference between these two band intensities to the sum:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED} \\]\nThis creates a ‘normalized’ index that should be between -1 (water) and 1 (maximum vegitation). xarray makes it easy to compute operations on different bands (variables), e.g. we can compute the difference between each \\((X, Y, Time)\\) coordinate in the NIR wavelength to thhat of the red wavelength as data.nir08 - data.red. We can also compute summary statistics across dimensions. Here, becuase we have 4 different timepoints, we will take the median measurement over time – a common summary statistic that is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Lastly, we will drop any “bad” pixels, where the NDVI value is greater than 1.\n\nndvi = (\n    ((data.nir08 - data.red) / (data.red + data.nir08))\n    .median(\"time\", keep_attrs=True)\n)\n\nndvi = ndvi.where(ndvi &lt; 1).compute()\n\n\nndvi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray (y: 1627, x: 1220)&gt; Size: 16MB\narray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 13kB 4.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06 4.566e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 10kB 6.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05 6.8e+05\n    spatial_ref  int32 4B 32618xarray.DataArrayy: 1627x: 12200.8859 0.8805 0.8716 0.9001 0.8955 0.9044 ... nan nan nan nan nan nanarray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])Coordinates: (3)y(y)float644.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06units :metreresolution :-10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([4582615., 4582605., 4582595., ..., 4566375., 4566365., 4566355.])x(x)float646.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05units :metreresolution :10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([667815., 667825., 667835., ..., 679985., 679995., 680005.])spatial_ref()int3232618spatial_ref :PROJCRS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N\",BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],ID[\"EPSG\",4326]],CONVERSION[\"UTM zone 18N\",METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",-75,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",0.9996,SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],PARAMETER[\"False easting\",500000,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],PARAMETER[\"False northing\",0,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],CS[Cartesian,2],AXIS[\"(E)\",east,ORDER[1],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],AXIS[\"(N)\",north,ORDER[2],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],USAGE[SCOPE[\"Navigation and medium accuracy spatial referencing.\"],AREA[\"Between 78°W and 72°W, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to ESPM-157: Data Science in Global Change Ecology. This in-development course presents an opinionated approach to learning the tools of data science through the lens of global change problems. Many of these opinions are anchored in deeply researched pedagogy and experience, some are not.\nAfter seven years of teaching in R, this version of the course is taught in Python. The R community has benefitted tremendously in recent years from an close-knit, inclusive and welcoming community of instructors and software developers, including a notable committment to learning and pegagogy from the company formerly known as RStudio its team of open source developers of the “tidyverse” under Hadley Wickham. Jenny Bryan (Statistics professor from UBC and a developer at RStudio) became an internet sensation for her ground-breaking open course, STAT-545, which heavily influenced the early development of ESPM-157 and many similar courses in R, which among other things helped pioneer teaching GitHub ‘from day 1’ and led to the creation of https://happygitwithr.com.\n\nIt’s Abstractions All the Way Down, JD Long, Posit-Conf 2023.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nData Science Lifecycle in DS100 book, Learning Data Science By Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan.\nIntro in R for Data Science\n\nR4DS view:\n\nThe DS100 view of data cycle",

Most classes present students with data that has been cleaned up for ‘instructional purposes’, readily available and subset to small, easy-to-work-with sizes. This leaves many students of data science or computer science rather ill-prepared in encountering real-world data, as the very first steps required before they can apply all their knowledge of processing, modeling and visualizing are precisely the steps we didn’t teach.

    "text": "This executable notebook provides an opening example to illustrate a cloud-native workflow in both R and python. Pedagogy research emphasizes the importance of “playing the whole game” before breaking down every pitch and hit. We intentionally focus on powerful high-level tools (STAC API, COGs, datacubes) to illustrate how a few chunks of code can perform a task that would be far slower and more verbose in a traditional file-based, download-first workflow. Note the close parallels between R and Python syntax. This arises because both languages wrap the same underlying tools (the STAC API and GDAL warper) and handle many of the nuisances of spatial data – from re-projections and resampling to mosaic tiles – without us noticing.\n\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ngdalcubes::gdalcubes_options(parallel = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in many workflows involves discovering individual spatial data files covering the space, time, and variables of interest. Here we use a STAC Catalog API to recover a list of candidate data. We dig deeper into how this works and what it returns in later recipes. This example searches for images in a lon-lat bounding box from a collection of Cloud-Optimized-GeoTIFF (COG) images taken by Sentinel2 satellite mission. This function will not download any imagery, it merely gives us a list of metadata about available images, including the access URLs.\n\nbox &lt;- c(xmin=-122.51, ymin=37.71, xmax=-122.36, ymax=37.81) \nstart_date &lt;- \"2022-06-01\"\nend_date &lt;- \"2022-08-01\"\nitems &lt;-\n  stac(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/\") |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs\",\n              bbox = box,\n              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep=\"/\"),\n              limit = 100) |&gt;\n  ext_query(\"eo:cloud_cover\" &lt; 20) |&gt;\n  post_request()\n\nWe pass this list of images to a high-level utilty (gdalcubes in R, odc.stac in python) that will do all of the heavy lifting. Using the URLs and metadata provided by STAC, these functions can extract only our data of interest (given by the bounding box) without downloading unnecessary regions or bands. While streaming the data, these functions will also reproject it into the desired coordinate reference system – (an often costly operation to perform in R) and can potentially resample or aggregate the data to a desired spatial resolution.

All though this racist practice was banned by federal law under the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the systemic scars of that practice are still so deeply etched on our landscape that the remain visible from space – “red-lined” areas (graded “D” under the racist HOLC scheme) show systematically lower greenness than predominately-white neighborhoods (Grade “A”). Trees provide many benefits, from mitigating urban heat to biodiversity, real-estate value, to health.\n\n\nIn addition to large scale raster data such as satellite imagery, the analysis of vector shapes such as polygons showing administrative regions is a central component of spatial analysis, and particularly important to spatial social sciences. The red-lined areas of the 1930s are one example of spatial vectors.
