title: "Computing Setup (2026)"
---

This guide covers the initial setup for our 2026 computing environment, focusing on VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and R.

### 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have one, sign up at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication
Required before applying for the Student Developer Pack.
1. Go to [github.com/settings/security](https://github.com/settings/security)
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
3. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) or SMS.

### 3. Add Your Name & Address to Billing
This helps verify your identity — no payment info required.
1. Go to [github.com/settings/billing/payment_information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information)
2. Add your name as it appears on your student ID.
3. For address, you can use the university address:
   `Wellman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720`

### 4. Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack
The Student Developer Pack gives you free access to GitHub Copilot and other tools.
Apply at: [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

##### Berkeley-Specific Tips
- **School**: Select "UC Berkeley" from the list.
- **Email**: Use your `@berkeley.edu` address.
- **Location**: Enable location sharing when prompted.
- **Browser**: Use Firefox or Chrome (Safari often blocks location sharing).
- **Student ID photo**: As long as your billing info name matches your ID, you'll be approved.

### 5. Install VS Code
Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it for your operating system.

### 6. Install Extensions

The following VS Code extensions are required or highly recommended for this course. To install them, open the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`), search for the extension, and click **Install**.

*   **R** (by Yuki Ueda): Support for the R language.
*   **Air (Posit)**: The next-generation extension for R and Python from Posit.
*   **Quarto**: Support for Quarto documents (`.qmd`).
*   **Shiny**: Tools for developing Shiny applications.
*   **Docker**: Support for working with containers.
*   **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered coding assistance. (Requires GitHub Student Pack approval).
*   **Continue**: An open-source AI assistant for VS Code.

#### Additional Setup for R
After installing the R extension, it's recommended to install the `languageserver` package in R:
```r
install.packages("languageserver")
```

### 7. R Setup
Ensure you have R installed on your machine. You can download it from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### 8. Python Setup (Miniconda)
Some R packages and many AI tools require a Python environment. We recommend installing **Miniconda**, a minimal installer for conda.

1. Download the installer for your OS from the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
3. When asked, we recommend letting the installer initialize Miniconda by running `conda init`.
