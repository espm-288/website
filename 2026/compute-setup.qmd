title: "Computing Setup (2026)"
---

This guide covers the initial setup for our 2026 computing environment, focusing on VS Code, GitHub Copilot, and R.

### 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don't already have one, sign up at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup).

### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication
Required before applying for the Student Developer Pack.
1. Go to [github.com/settings/security](https://github.com/settings/security)
2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA).
3. Use an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator) or SMS.

### 3. Add Your Name & Address to Billing
This helps verify your identity — no payment info required.
1. Go to [github.com/settings/billing/payment_information](https://github.com/settings/billing/payment_information)
2. Add your name as it appears on your student ID.
3. For address, you can use the university address:
   `Wellman Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720`

### 4. Apply for GitHub Student Developer Pack
The Student Developer Pack gives you free access to GitHub Copilot and other tools.
Apply at: [education.github.com/pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

##### Berkeley-Specific Tips
- **School**: Select "UC Berkeley" from the list.
- **Email**: Use your `@berkeley.edu` address.
- **Location**: Enable location sharing when prompted.
- **Browser**: Use Firefox or Chrome (Safari often blocks location sharing).
- **Student ID photo**: As long as your billing info name matches your ID, you'll be approved.

### 5. Install VS Code
Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it for your operating system.

### 6. Install Extensions

#### GitHub Copilot
Once your Student Developer Pack is approved:
1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+X` (Mac) to open Extensions.
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot" and click **Install**.
4. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted.

#### R Extension
To work with R in VS Code:
1. Search for "R" in the Extensions view (by Yuki Ueda).
2. Click **Install**.
3. It's also recommended to install the `languageserver` package in R:
   ```r
   install.packages("languageserver")
   ```

### 7. R Setup
Ensure you have R installed on your machine. You can download it from [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/).
