    "text": "Intro to GitHub & JupyterHub\nGitHub & Jupyter are two core platforms in our course and across data science. Over the course of this semester we will becoming very familiar with both, beginning with the most commonly used features and progressing to leveraging the more advanced corners of each.\n\nCloud Platforms\nBoth GitHub and JupyterHub are cloud based platforms. The term “cloud” is a fanciful way of saying that this software is running on “someone else’s computer,” usually (but not always), this means in a massive data center with rack upon rack of computers. Many of these data centers are owned by one of only a handful of ‘cloud providers’ – such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google, Microsoft, or IBM, among others. In both cases, we will access these platforms through a web browser.\nA key concept that takes some getting used to is thinking about where our data ‘lives’ when working on these platforms. Remember that with each of these platforms, we are working on ‘someone else’s computer’. The browser only gives us a window into that computer. Documents you create on JupyterHub don’t automatically exist on your laptop. If your laptop completely died and you logged into JupyterHub on another platform, your work would still be there. However, if your partner logs into their JupyterHub, they are allocated their own separate computer. To share your work with your partner, your instructors, or the larger world, we will be using GitHub. GitHub is running on yet another computer (actually many connected computers), and we must push our work from the JupyterHub machine to GitHub, or pull changes from GitHub into JupyterHub. While many cloud-based services (like DropBox) automate some of these steps, data science tools such as git give us much more control of what and when we share.\n\n\nGitHub\nGitHub is a commercial website platform acquired by Microsoft and widely used by software developers for collaborative work on both public and private code bases. GitHub is built git, an open-source software for version control orginally created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux. Many other open and proprietary platforms also use git as their foundation (notably GitLab and HuggingFace). While many other open source version control utilities exist besides git, git is easily the most widely used today. GitHub is a primary mechanism for ‘publishing’ or distributing software source-code, notebooks and much else. We will be using GitHub as a way of sharing code with your partner and submitting your assignments. While GitHub’s web interface is quite user friendly, the underlying technology of git has a reputation for being quite complex – in fact based on precisely the same technological ideas as the “block-chain”, although it has existed long before anyone decided to apply those ideas to currency. Many instructors therefore avoid teaching GitHub and git in courses!\n\nCreate an acount on GitHub\nUse the GitHub Classroom magic link distributed in class to create a GitHub repository under the course’s GitHub Organization espm-157.\n\nContinue below. As we progress, we will learn more about how to use git and GitHub – how to recover earlier versions, create branches and pull requests, leverage automation in GitHub Actions and much else.\n\n\nJupyterHub\nThe Project Jupyter is an open-source initiative created and led by our own Fernando Perez and collaborators around the world. JupyterHub will be our home platform for the most of our work, where we will write and run code to perform tasks. Because we are running ‘on the cloud’ – on someone else’s computer, this avoids the requirement of having to install all the necessary software used in this course on your laptop. This also means that the computational heavy-lifting is all performed by the remote computer – so we will not rely on students having powerful new laptops to complete computationally intensive tasks. This does not mean that it is necessary to use a cloud provider to do things we do. All the software we are using is free and open source and can be installed on your own computer. Indeed, it is even possible for your computer to act like it’s own data center, talking to itself over precisely the same network protocols we would use to talk to a distant machine. In this way, JupyterHub ‘abstracts’ the computational environment away from the physical hardware, making it easy to deploy a workflow on machine of the appropriate size for the task at hand – be it a tiny application or massive job for a supercomputing center.\n\nLog in to our JupyterHub, https://nature.datahub.berkeley.edu\n\nJupyterHub, JupyterLab, and Jupyter Notebooks – the Jupyter ecosystem is a rich and changing landscape, which can often be confusing! A JupyterHub (such as ours, https://nature.datahub.berkeley.edu, sometimes refered to at Berkeley as a DataHub) can serve many users with individual instances of the JupyterLab (a web-based IDE), which can in turn allow a user to work with many Jupyter Notebooks (and many other file formats and interfaces, including RStudio and the open-source Visual Studio Code Server). Jupyter Notebooks are individual files (previously known as ipython notebooks, and still indicated with ipynb extension), a JSON-based serialization combining code, code outputs, and markdown text. These notebooks are used throughout the data science community in industry and academia, and can be used not only in a JupyterLab IDE but in a wide variety of IDEs that have shamelessly copied it, including Google Colab, Microsoft VSCode, and Amazon SageMaker.\n\n\nInitial setup\nAuthentication\nThere’s a few one-time setup steps we need to work with Git and GitHub from Jupyterhub. First, in order to access private repositories, we need a way for our JupyterHub instance to authenticate our identity when trying to access our private stuff on GitHub, or when trying to share (write) stuff to our GitHub account. For security purposes, we will use a token-based authentication process to authenticate with GitHub.\nTry to clone our “authentication” repo, https://github.com/espm-157-f24/auth into your Jupyterhub using the Clone Repository button from the Git menu (left side). (We will review this together in class).\n\nThen use the “File” menu on the left side to open the auth folder and then opn the Jupyter Notebook, github-login.ipynb. Try running the cell in that notebook.\n\nTada! You have authenticated with GitHub on your Jupyterhub. In future, you will only need to re-open this login notebook to authenticate, as it will remain on your JupyterHub.\nYou can now clone private repositories. Note that before you can clone a new repository, you will need to navigate your file-pane out of the current auth/ repo and back to the home directory by clicking the folder icon.\nIntroduce yourself to git\nCommits in Git are ‘signed’ to indicate who made the changes. The first time git is set up it needs to know the user’s name and email by running the following commands in a terminal. Use the “launcher” menu in Jupyter to open a new terminal and run the following commands.\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email \"you@berkeley.edu\"\nSome users perfer to use pseudonyms. The email does not have to be valid, though using the same address as you registered with GitHub will let it display your commits as comming from you. Now that git knows who you are, we are ready to start making our own commits.",

Much has changed, much will change, and this course is changing with it. Welcome aboard.\n\n\nThere is no required textbook for this course at this time. Recommended readings will be indicated when available and further developed during this course.\n\n\n\n\nLike too many UC Berkeley courses, ESPM-157 is oversubscribed. Registration for ESPM-157 follows the campus staged process with reserved seats for several of the specific majors in the host department (ESPM) as determined by Rasser College of Natural Resources (RCNR) scheduling and academic advising staff. All seats go quickly, so please plan to enroll as soon as you are eligible to do so. Students in ESPM-based majors should speak to their major adviser about enrolling in ESPM-157 and reserved seats. Please do not contact course instructors about permission to enroll or enrollment codes for reserved seats, this process is handled by RCNR Scheduling to be as fair and equitable as possible across student groups needing this course to meet graduation requirements. We are constantly exploring ways to expand access to this course without degrading the educational experience. Graduate students interested in 157 should consider ESPM 288, usually offered each Spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis course centers around our in-class experience. We meet for 2 hours twice a week for a hands-on, group-based experience facilitated by your instructors. Lectures will not be recorded because there will not be lectures. Built on decades of education research and delivered in the most recent state-of-the art Active Learning Classroom on campus, this course emphasizes a collaborative learning-by-doing approach in all elements. Today, there are a wealth of lectures in data science that can be viewed freely without a university tuition. Education research shows the value of hands-on, peer based experience which we have the opportunity to create in our classroom. We recognize that things happen and students will not be penalized if they cannot make a session\nThe course is built on four open-ended modules and final project. In each, students will work in pairs (and occassionally individually) to replicate or refute the main scientific findings of a key paper or result in global change ecology. Each module is selected to introduce a core set of competencies in data science, fundamental concepts in global change ecology, and new skills for reproducible research and data-driven communication.\n\n\n\n\nThis course has no formal prerequisites.

It is expected that students in this course will have a wide range of prior experience and ability, and grading will aim to reflect learning and effort in the course. This course is not graded “on a curve” compared to other students. Grades will reflect relative individual learning and improvement from earlier benchmarks. It is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course if all of you show mastery of the material and completely attempt all assignments. However, high competency that does not reflect learning gains or the stylistic expectations of this course may score quite poorly. Our course prizes concise, semantic code supported by clear and insightful text and figures.\nAll assignments are due by immediately before the start of class on the day indicated. Assignments should be submitted as instructed.\n\n\n\nLate assignments may be docked 20% and will not be accepted more than 48 hours late except in cases of genuine emergencies or in cases where this has been discussed and approved in advance. This policy is based on the idea that in order to learn how to use computers well, students should be working with them at multiple times each week. Time has been allotted in class for working on assignments and students are expected to work on them outside of class. It is intended that you should have finished as much of the assignment as you can based on what we have covered in class by the following class period. Therefore, even if something unexpected happens at the last minute you should already be close to done with the assignment. This policy also allows rapid feedback to be provided to students by returning assignments quickly.\n\n\n\nOur course is committed to providing a respectful and welcoming environment to all participants. Please review the Open Code of Conduct guidelines for respectful and harassment-free conduct. To report an incident or request more information, contact the UC Berkeley Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination by emailing ask_ophd@berkeley.edu or by phone (510) 643-7985.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates and your instructional team as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally. Please identify your collaborators by name on all assignments.\nSince you’re working collaboratively, keep your project partner and the course instructor informed. If some medical or personal emergency takes you away from the course for an extended period, or if you decide to drop the course for any reason, please don’t just disappear silently! You should inform your project partner, so that nobody is depending on you to do something you can’t finish.\n\n\n\nGenerative AI is very much a part of the modern data science landscape and will be a part of our course. This technology also raises legal, ethical and environmental issues, as technology has done before. We will seek to address and discuss both the opportunities and challenges through hands-on experience with examples of this technology.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no quizzes or in-class exams in this course.\n\n\n\nStudents should bring a laptop and charger to each class. You do not need a fancy machine – any device with a keyboard, web browser and wifi should be sufficient to connect to our cloud-based compute platform which will be doing all the heavy lifting. If you don’t have access to a laptop please request a device through our campus STEP program.\n\n\n\nOur course aspires towards universal design principles to minimize the need for common accommodations such as extra time on written exams or recording devices for lectures (we have no timed exams and no lectures). We are always keen to improve the design and provide additional accomdations to make this course accessible for all students.\nIf you need an accommodation for a disability, if you have information your wish to share with the instructor about a medical emergency, or if you need special arrangements if the building needs to be evacuated, please inform the instructor as soon as possible.\nIf you are not currently listed with DSP (the Disabled Students’ Program) and believe you might benefit from their support, please apply online at https://dsp.berkeley.edu."

    "text": "Having generated a Cloud-Optimized GeoTiff (COG) file containing our NDVI calculations, we are now ready to return to our redlining data and determine if indeed we still see the legacy of those racist practices more than 50 years after they were outlawed.\nThe aggregation of raster pixels grouped by their containing polygons is something like the spatial equivalent of our .group_by() + .aggregate() operations in ibis, where the raster defines the values and the polygons define the groups.\nTo compute the average NDVI in each polygon, we will introduce yet another module – exactextract. This package can efficiently compute summary statistics for each polygon given a raster image. While several different modules can perform this kind of aggregation, exactextract is quite fast and scalable, using an efficient algorithm in C++, and gets it’s name for an ability to account for fractional coverage of a raster cell by a polygon, like so.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\nfrom exactextract import exact_extract\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\n\nWe begin as before by grabbing our remote city data.

While we have already transformed our raster data to the ‘longitude, latitude’ coordinates, EPSG:4326, we need to manually add this annotation to declare that our parquet data is already using this projection as well.

    "text": "Now that we’ve been able to import our first type of spatial data and begin manipulating it using our familiar libraries, we want to put it on a map!\nWe begin with the code we developed last time for accessing the redlining data for a single city as a geopandas object:\n::: {#51269dee-9bbf-48cf-a1d3-f54bf7d6b664 .cell 0=‘h’ 1=‘i’ 2=‘d’ 3=‘e’ execution_count=16}\nfrom IPython.display import IFrame\n:::\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\ncity = (con\n    .read_geo(\"/vsicurl/https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n    .filter(_.city == \"New Haven\")\n    .execute()\n)\n\nWe will be using leafmap to create interactive maps. There are a wide range of mapping packages that have been developed for python (e.g. bokeh, kepler, folium, pydeck, lonboard, pymaplibre-gl), most of which wrap around javascript mapping libraries designed for interactive web-based maps. Just as the ibis package provides an interface to a host of different database engines that can be used as ‘backends’, leafmap wraps around most of the common mapping engines with a friendly and mostly consistent user interface. In ibis we have focused on the duckdb backend as the most powerful, flexible and performant option for all our purposes. With leafmap, we will likewise focus on the most recent and generally most powerful backend option, maplibregl - an open source implementation of the powerful and widely used commericial javascript platform, Mapbox.\n\nimport leafmap.maplibregl as leafmap\n\n::: {#fe0906fd-60f1-455e-a184-012dbf328cec .cell 0=‘h’ 1=‘i’ 2=‘d’ 3=‘e’ 4=‘-’ 5=‘o’ 6=‘u’ 7=‘t’ 8=‘p’ 9=‘u’ 10=‘t’ execution_count=19}\nm = leafmap.Map(style=\"positron\")\nm.add_gdf(city)\nm\n\n\n\n:::\nBecause our map is an interactive javascript applet, putting m at the end of the a cell will allow it to display inline in Jupyter, but not in ‘static’ documentation such as the course website or a GitHub rendering of the notebook.

The example below illustrates some more complex patterns for generating a rich map.\n\nWe introduce a basemap with add_basemap(). This is just a background image, that is tiled to re-draw to the appropriate zoom and window. However, note that basemaps are just background images, we cannot extract actual data from these sources.\nWe have added source data by pointing to a remote URL. This provides much better performance than embedding the JSON data directly, especially when the data become very large. This requires the data is hosted at a highly available provider, such as GitHub or another cloud service. The original host source won’t work unfortunately.\n\nWe have used a custom filter inside the source data to select our city of interest. This could be omitted.\nWe have colored our polygons according to grade given in the data. Specifically, we noticed that the column “fill” already contains color codes in HEX format corresponding to the redlining “grade” associated with each layer.\nWe have added a final layer of text labels based on the “label” column.\n\n\nimport json\ngeojson = json.loads(city.to_json())\n\n\nm = leafmap.Map(center=[-72.9, 41.3], zoom=12)\n\nsource = {\n    \"type\": \"geojson\", \n#    'data':

Norway and Canada stand out for the largest harvests. The ‘grammar of graphics’ in Seaborn objects makes it easy to quickly visually explore the data along different dimensions.

While we see declines in some Eastern stocks, the pattern in the West is much more dramatic. If we want to consider the fate of Western Atlantic Cod as a whole, we can add up all these individual stocks to get a picture for the entire FAO Region. We call the resulting table cod_fao because now it no longer reflects individual stocks, we have summed all the individual stocks up when we aggregated to the level of entire FAO regions.\n\ncod_fao = (cod_stocks\n   .group_by(_.tsyear, _.primary_FAOarea)\n   .agg(catch = _.catch.sum())\n)\n\n\nOnce again we can get a visual sense of the resulting aggrecations.  \n\n\n(\n    so.Plot(cod_fao, \n            x = \"tsyear\", \n            y=\"catch\")\n    .add(so.Lines(linewidth=3))\n    .facet(\"primary_FAOarea\")\n)",

    "text": "ibis Table Joins\n\nLearning Goals\n\nuse join() to combine two tables on a key column\n\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\nimport ibis.selectors as s\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nLast time we started getting comfortable with lazy evaluation (head() and execute()) in ibis, and began to learn how to select() (subset columns) and filter() (subset rows), as well as looking at distinct values. Today we will continue to draw on these skills as we go deeper into the fisheries data in search of the evidence of the North Atlantic Cod collapse. In the process, we shall pick up some new methods as well.\nAs before, let’s start with reading in data. Rather than focus on the metrics table, this time we will connect to several tables at the same time. Note how we can reuse the base_url to avoid extra typing, but take care that we reading the right CSV file in each case! As before, we explicitly set the nullstr value as well to ensure missing value codes are correctly interpreted.\n\nbase_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/cboettig/ram_fisheries/resolve/main/v4.65/\"\n\nstock = con.read_csv(base_url + \"stock.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\ntimeseries = con.read_csv(base_url + \"timeseries.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\nassessment = con.read_csv(base_url + \"assessment.csv\", nullstr=\"NA\")\n\n\n\nFish ‘stocks’\nLike most real world data science problems, understanding these tables requires both a bit of background in fisheries science and a lot of splunking into the data. For our purposes, one of the key things you should know is that fisheries are divided into “stocks”, which you can think of as a particular species of fish in a particular area of the ocean. Let’s use the stock table to explore this idea a bit more. Let’s begin with a peek at the stock table:\n\nstock\n\nDatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_5sjnrevlzzaijnrmxgnnonpheq\n  stockid         string\n  tsn             int64\n  scientificname  string\n  commonname      string\n  areaid          string\n  stocklong       string\n  region          string\n  primary_country string\n  primary_FAOarea int64\n  ISO3_code       string\n  GRSF_uuid       string\n  GRSF_areaid     string\n  inmyersdb       int64\n  myersstockid    string\n  state           string\n\n\n\nAh! commonname looks like a good place as any to go looking for Atlantic cod. Of course if we knew (or looked up) the scientific name of the species, that might be even better – after all, common names are not always as precise. Let’s see what we can find:\n\n(stock\n .filter(_.commonname == \"Atlantic cod\")\n .select(_.stockid, _.scientificname, _.commonname, \n         _.areaid, _.region, _.primary_country, _.ISO3_code)\n .head()\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstockid\nscientificname\ncommonname\nareaid\nregion\nprimary_country\nISO3_code\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOD1ABCDE\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1ABCDE\nCanada East Coast\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n1\nCOD1F-XIV\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1F-XIV\nEurope non EU\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n2\nCOD1IN\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-ICES-1IN\nCanada East Coast\nGreenland\nGRL\n\n\n3\nCOD2J3KL\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nCanada-DFO-2J3KL\nCanada East Coast\nCanada\nCAN\n\n\n4\nCOD3M\nGadus morhua\nAtlantic cod\nmultinational-NAFO-3M\nCanada East Coast\nPortugal\nPRT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of stocks of Atlantic cod! Each row begins with a unique stockid. A column that uniquely identifies each row in a given table is often referred to as the “primary key” for that table (and is often but not necessarily listed first). The rows that follow give us some sense of what defines a “stock” as a species in an area: we see a few different identifiers for the species: commonname, scientificname. We also see information abot the area the stock occurs in – such as areaid, region, and primary country. (For display purposes we selected only a subset of columns).\nWhile we have found the Cod, we haven’t yet found any data about the cod catch over time! For that we will need to look in the timeseries data. Let’s see how it is organized:\n\ntimeseries.head().execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassessid\nstockid\nstocklong\ntsid\ntsyear\ntsvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1960\nNaN\n\n\n1\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1961\nNaN\n\n\n2\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1962\nNaN\n\n\n3\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1963\nNaN\n\n\n4\nABARES-BGRDRSE-1960-2011-CHING\nBGRDRSE\nBlue grenadier Southeast Australia\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1964\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe again have a column called stockid. While we no longer have columns such as commonname or scientificname to tell us what species each row in the timeseries is measuring, we now know that we can look up that information in the stock table using the stockid. Such a column is often called a “foreign key”, because it matches the primary key of a separate table. (it appears the timeseries data has no ‘primary key’ of it’s own – no column that has a unique value for each row.). Rather than have to switch back and forth between two tables, we can join the two tables on stockid:\n\n(stock\n .filter(_.commonname == \"Atlantic cod\")\n .join(timeseries, \"stockid\")\n .head()\n .select(_.stockid, _.scientificname, _.tsid, _.tsyear, \n         _.tsvalue, _.stocklong, _.stocklong_right) # subset of columns to keep display narrow\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstockid\nscientificname\ntsid\ntsyear\ntsvalue\nstocklong\nstocklong_right\n\n\n\n\n0\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1958\n0.997804\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n1\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1959\n1.706091\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n2\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1960\n1.308003\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n3\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1961\n1.713846\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n4\nCOD4VsW\nGadus morhua\nCdivMEANC-ratio\n1962\n1.685411\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\nAtlantic cod Eastern Scotian Shelf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectively all this has done is take our timeseries table and for each stockid, add extra columns explaining what the stock table tells us about the stockid - species names, areas, and so on. The join has made our data is much wider than before – we have all the columns from both tables. (Note that both tables happened to have one column with the same name, stocklong. A truly tidy database would not have done this – we can easily see that this information belongs in the stock table. Because our database cannot assume these are the same when we join, it has renamed the one on the “right” (from timeseries) as “stocklong_right” to distinguish them). Because each stockid was repeated in the timeseries table, now all this other information is repeated too. This is not as inefficient as it may sound, thanks to internal optimizations in the database.\nWhile it is clear even from this head() preview that we have the columns from both tables, what about the rows? Our stock table was already filtered to a subset of rows containing only Cod stocks. This join (technically called an “inner join”) has kept only those stockids, so we now have timeseries only about Cod! In fact, we could have instead joined the full tables for all stock ids, and then applied the filter for commonname.\n\n\nExercise\nTry further exploring this resulting table using select() and distinct() to get a better sense of what rows are here. You will notice additional “*id” columns, like asssesid or areaid matching other tables in the data. Explore filtering and joinging with these tables as well.",

    "text": "Analysis-ready data, or ‘tidy data’, is a central concept in data science. The term was coined by Hadley Wickham1 to describe best practices long known in the relational database community, specifically, conventions around formatting tabular data known as Cobb’s Third Normal Form. In this form, each row represents an observation and each column represents a variable. These conventions allow us to leverage powerful software and techniques for data analysis and visualization more easily, as many such tools are designed with tidy data structures in mind. However, wild-caught data often does not follow these rules. Consider this example of NASA data on land ice mass:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"http://climate.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/499_GRN_ANT_mass_changes.csv\",\n                skiprows=10, names=['date', 'greenland', 'antarctica'])\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\ngreenland\nantarctica\n\n\n\n\n0\n2002.29\n1490.68\n967.20\n\n\n1\n2002.35\n1485.69\n978.55\n\n\n2\n2002.62\n1286.84\n512.02\n\n\n3\n2002.71\n1257.85\n858.85\n\n\n4\n2002.79\n1257.17\n693.87\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n135\n2014.45\n-1672.08\n-1021.70\n\n\n136\n2014.62\n-1985.59\n-1067.84\n\n\n137\n2014.71\n-2024.82\n-780.87\n\n\n138\n2014.79\n-1973.96\n-904.38\n\n\n139\n2014.88\n-1911.78\n-1009.80\n\n\n\n\n140 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nThe column heading we have called ‘greenland’ is not a single variable (feature) being observed, but in fact a mashup of two different variables – the ice mass (in gigatons) on the location of Greenland. (In the original data file it has the name Greenland mass (Gt), which more clearly indicates this mash-up but does not follow our naming conventions. Likewise the column called ‘antarctica’ again measures land ice mass, but at a different location. A “tidy” version of this data would use one column to indicate location (Greenland or Antarctica) and another column to indicate ice mass at that location.\nTo fix this, we need to pivot the data table into a “long” form, with a single column for ice mass and a single column for location. While there are many ways to do this, we will rely on the ibis framework which provides one of the most consistent and powerful interfaces for tabular data operations. We begin by loading the ibis library and establishing a “connection” to a backend engine.\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import selectors as s\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nWe add our pandas table to the ibis connection using the method create_table. This allows us to manipulate the table using ibis methods rather than pandas. We will later see other ways to create ibis tables directly from a wide range of data other than pandas data.frames.\nWe then use the pivot_longer() method to transform our data. We use the ibis.selectors methods to indicate which columns we are aggregating in the pivot. Optionally, we indicate the name of the new column that will contain the previous column names (greenland, antarctica) and the name of the column that will contain the cell values (the ice mass).\n\nland_ice = (con\n .create_table(\"land_ice\", df, overwrite=True)\n .pivot_longer(s.any_of('greenland', 'antarctica'),\n               names_to= \"location\", values_to = \"ice_mass\")\n)\n\nland_ice.execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nlocation\nice_mass\n\n\n\n\n0\n2002.29\ngreenland\n1490.68\n\n\n1\n2002.29\nantarctica\n967.20\n\n\n2\n2002.35\ngreenland\n1485.69\n\n\n3\n2002.35\nantarctica\n978.55\n\n\n4\n2002.62\ngreenland\n1286.84\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n275\n2014.71\nantarctica\n-780.87\n\n\n276\n2014.79\ngreenland\n-1973.96\n\n\n277\n2014.79\nantarctica\n-904.38\n\n\n278\n2014.88\ngreenland\n-1911.78\n\n\n279\n2014.88\nantarctica\n-1009.80\n\n\n\n\n280 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nNote the use of .execute() at the end of the ibis command to see the results. ibis uses a sophisticated strategy called “lazy evaluation”, in which it does not actually run the code we provide until absolutely necessary. While this feels cumbersome now, these small extra steps will pay big dividends for us when we move to big data sources that historically courses have needed to teach entirely different tools for.\nNow that are data is ‘tidy’, some operations are much easier. For instance, plotting two lines, with a legend, merely requires the single aesthetic mapping of color to the location column: color = \"location\"\n\nimport seaborn.objects as so\np = (so.Plot(land_ice, \n             x = \"date\", \n             y = \"ice_mass\", \n             color = \"location\")\n     .add(so.Line())\n    )\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can map this additional column to different aesthetics just as easily. This illustrates the value of well-structured data and abstract grammar for operating on it. For instance, having subplots (facets) based on this data:\n\np.facet(\"location\")",

And we believe students should be able to leverage those things, easily and rapidly deploying cloud-hosted images, and will get to that here. But most of the time, we just want to copy-paste a few lines of code and expect it to work. Many layers of the onion can be found between these two extremes – from package dependencies and system dependencies to containers, orchestration, metadata, even hardware requirements.\nIn the examples here, copy-pasting the code blocks into your preferred environment should work in most cases. Sometimes it may be necessary to install specific libraries or specific versions of those libraries. And for fastest setup and maximum reproducibility, users can deploy the fully containerized environment. It should be as easy as possible to grab the whole onion and take it where you want it – be that a local VSCode editor on your laptop, or an RStudio Server instance running up on Microsoft Azure cloud.\n\n\n\nEach of the recipes on this site correspond to a Quarto or Jupyter notebook in a GitHub repository (see contents/ directory or footer links). Such notebooks form the basis of technical documentation and publishing to a wide array of formats. A _quarto.yml configuration file in the repository root determines the website layout. Notebooks can be run interactively in any appropriate environment (RStudio, JupyterLab, VSCode, etc, see below for free online platforms). Type quarto render from the bash command line or use quarto::quarto_preview() from the R console to preview the entire site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBoth GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod provide a fast and simple way to enter into integrated development environments such as VSCode, RStudio, or JupyterLab on free, cloud-based virtual machines. Codespaces has a free tier of 60 hours/month, Gitpod of 50 hours a month, both offer paid plans for additional use and larger compute instances. Small codespace instances are also free to instructors\nBy clicking on one of the buttons in GitHub, users will be placed into a free cloud-based virtual machine running a VSCode editor in their web browser. The first setup can take a few minutes to complete.\nAdditionally, this also provides access to an RStudio environment on an embedded port for users who prefer that editor to VSCode. Once the Codespace has fully completed loading, it will include a link in a second welcome message in the Terminal to access RStudio like so:\n\nThe RStudio link can also always be accessed from the Ports tab under the port labeled “Rstudio” (8787). (Gitpod will show a pop-up message to open this port instead.)\nBoth Codespaces and Gitpod can be configured with custom compute environments by supplying a docker image. Both the VSCode and RStudio editors run in the same underlying custom Docker container. This repository includes a Dockerfile defining this compute environment which includes specific versions of R and python packages, the latest releases of the OSGeo C libraries GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS that power many spatial operations in both languages. These elements are pre-compiled in a Docker container based on the latest Ubuntu LTS release (22.04 at the time of writing), which itself is build according to the Dockerfile found in this repository using a GitHub Action. The devcontainer.json configuration will also set up relevant VSCode extensions for both both Jupyter and Quarto notebooks, with each supporting both R and Python.\n\n\n\nOpen this repository in a local Visual Studio Code editor on a Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop and you will probably be prompted “Do you want to open this in project in a Dev Container?” If you agree, VSCode will attempt to use a local Docker installation to pull a container with much of the required software already installed. This uses the same Docker container and enables all the same extensions in VSCode, including RStudio server on the embedded port.\nOf course, users can open this project in a local VSCode or any other favorite editor without opening in the devcontainer. The user assumes responsibility to install necessary software, i.e. the packages listed in requirements.txt or install.R. Note that doing so does not ensure that the same version of system libraries like GDAL, PROJ, or GEOS will necessarily be used. For most operations this should not matter, but users on older versions of GDAL may encounter worse performance or other difficulties.\n\n\n\nWe can sidesteps elements specific to the VSCode editor defined in the devcontainer.json configuration while still leveraging the same system libraries and pre-built packages. For example, a user could also choose to run (or extend) the underlying docker container independently, e.g.\ndocker run --rm -ti ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/nasa-tops:latest bash\nwhich opens a bash terminal inside the container. This approach is also compatible with most HPC setups using singularity instead of docker.\nSome users may not be familiar with editing and running code entirely from a bash shell, so the container also includes RStudio server and thus can be run to launch RStudio in an open port instead,\ndocker run -d -p 8787:8787 --user root -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \\\n  ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/nasa-tops:latest\nand visit http://localhost:8787 to connect.",

    "text": "Both GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod provide a fast and simple way to enter into integrated development environments such as VSCode, RStudio, or JupyterLab on free, cloud-based virtual machines. Codespaces has a free tier of 60 hours/month, Gitpod of 50 hours a month, both offer paid plans for additional use and larger compute instances. Small codespace instances are also free to instructors\nBy clicking on one of the buttons in GitHub, users will be placed into a free cloud-based virtual machine running a VSCode editor in their web browser. The first setup can take a few minutes to complete.\nAdditionally, this also provides access to an RStudio environment on an embedded port for users who prefer that editor to VSCode. Once the Codespace has fully completed loading, it will include a link in a second welcome message in the Terminal to access RStudio like so:\n\nThe RStudio link can also always be accessed from the Ports tab under the port labeled “Rstudio” (8787). (Gitpod will show a pop-up message to open this port instead.)\nBoth Codespaces and Gitpod can be configured with custom compute environments by supplying a docker image. Both the VSCode and RStudio editors run in the same underlying custom Docker container. This repository includes a Dockerfile defining this compute environment which includes specific versions of R and python packages, the latest releases of the OSGeo C libraries GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS that power many spatial operations in both languages. These elements are pre-compiled in a Docker container based on the latest Ubuntu LTS release (22.04 at the time of writing), which itself is build according to the Dockerfile found in this repository using a GitHub Action. The devcontainer.json configuration will also set up relevant VSCode extensions for both both Jupyter and Quarto notebooks, with each supporting both R and Python.",

    "text": "Open this repository in a local Visual Studio Code editor on a Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop and you will probably be prompted “Do you want to open this in project in a Dev Container?” If you agree, VSCode will attempt to use a local Docker installation to pull a container with much of the required software already installed. This uses the same Docker container and enables all the same extensions in VSCode, including RStudio server on the embedded port.\nOf course, users can open this project in a local VSCode or any other favorite editor without opening in the devcontainer. The user assumes responsibility to install necessary software, i.e. the packages listed in requirements.txt or install.R. Note that doing so does not ensure that the same version of system libraries like GDAL, PROJ, or GEOS will necessarily be used. For most operations this should not matter, but users on older versions of GDAL may encounter worse performance or other difficulties.",

    "text": "This tutorial demonstrates how begin to generalize the pattern introduced in the introductory example to work with other data sources, in particular, with NASA EarthData.\nNASA recently announced completion of the transfer of some 59 petabytes of data to the Amazon cloud – a core component of NASA’s Transformation to Open Science (TOPS) mission. Researchers are frequently told that to take advantage of such “cloud data” they will need to pay (or find a grant or other program to pay) for cloud computing resources. This approach is sometimes describes as “send the compute to the data”. While this narrative is no doubt beneficial to Amazon Inc, it exacerbates inequity and is often misleading. The purpose of having data in a cloud storage platform is not just to make it faster to access that data on rented cloud computing platforms. The high bandwith and high disk speeds provided by these systems can be just as powerful when you provide your own compute. Consistent with NASA’s vision, this means that high-performance access is free\n\nNASA Earth science data have been freely openly and available to all users since EOSDIS became operational in 1994. Under NASA’s full and open data policy, all NASA mission data (along with the algorithms, metadata, and documentation associated with these data) must be freely available to the public. This means that anyone, anywhere in the world, can access the more than 59 PB of NASA Earth science data without restriction\n\nAll we need is software that can treat the cloud storage as if it were local storage: a virtual filesystem. The ability to do this – the HTTP range request standard – has been around for over two decades and is widely implemented in open source software. Unfortunately, many users and workflows are stuck in an old model that assumes individual files must always be downloaded first.\nTo make this work with NASA EarthData however, we have one additional challenge involving the problem of authentication. NASA offers several different mechanisms, including (1) netrc authentication, (2) token-based authentication, and (3) S3 credentials, but only the first of these works equally well from locations both inside and outside of AWS-based compute, so there really is very little reason to learn the other two.\nThe earthdatalogin package in R or the earthaccess package in Python handle the authentication. The R package sets up authentication behind the scenes using environmental variables.\n\nearthdatalogin::edl_netrc()\n\n(A default login is supplied though users are encouraged to register for their own individual accounts.) Once this is in place, EarthData’s protected URLs can be used like any other. For instance, after authenticating, we can read this NASA harmonized LandSat-Sentinel2 tif whether we are running locally:\n\nterra::rast(\"https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/lp-prod-protected/HLSL30.020/HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0/HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA.tif\",\n     vsi=TRUE)\n\nclass       : SpatRaster \ndimensions  : 3660, 3660, 1  (nrow, ncol, nlyr)\nresolution  : 30, 30  (x, y)\nextent      : 199980, 309780, 7190200, 7300000  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)\ncoord. ref. : WGS 84 / UTM zone 56N (EPSG:32656) \nsource      : HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA.tif \nname        : HLS.L30.T56JKT.2023246T235950.v2.0.SAA \n\n\nAn important aspect about this approach is that it does not require any custom wrappers or specialized functions to access data. Most R packages that work with spatial data, including terra, sf, stars and others, do so through the use of GDAL for parsing spatial data formats. This means that they all support the GDAL Virtual Filesystem for cloud-native reads out of the box. earthdatalogin() takes advantage of this by setting authentication credentials as GDAL environmental variable configuration, allowing these existing to seamlessly read NASA data. No need to learn any additional access functions.\n\n\n\nlibrary(earthdatalogin)\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\n\nearthdatalogin also includes optional configuration settings for GDAL which can improve performance of cloud-based data access. Set the GDAL environmental variables using gdal_cloud_config(). An additional helper function exposes the usual GDAL environmental variable to the gdalcubes R package.\n\nedl_netrc()           # Authenticate\ngdal_cloud_config()   # Optimize GDAL for cloud\nwith_gdalcubes()      # Export settings to gdalcubes package\n\ngdalcubes_options(parallel = TRUE)\n\nNASA provides their own search system. NASA also provides a STAC-based search (see below), which allows us to use the standard syntax we have already seen. However, NASA’s STAC API is significantly slower and more prone to server errors than the STAC APIs provided by Element84, Microsoft Planetary Computer, and others.\nHere, we use NASA’s own search protocol, which is less general, but gives us a chance to illustrate the use of gdalcubes using arbitrary URL lists when no STAC catalog is available. We search a handful of dates for illustrative purposes, but this approach can easily scale to larger lists without needing additional RAM or disk space.\n\nstart &lt;- \"2020-01-01\"\nend   &lt;- \"2020-01-03\" \nurls &lt;- edl_search(short_name = \"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n                   temporal = c(start, end))\n\nThese netcdf files lack appropriate metadata (projection, extent) that GDAL expects. We can provide this manually using the GDAL VRT mechanism:\n\nvrt &lt;- function(url) {\n  prefix &lt;-  \"vrt://NETCDF:/vsicurl/\"\n  suffix &lt;- \":analysed_sst?a_srs=OGC:CRS84&a_ullr=-180,90,180,-90\"\n  paste0(prefix, url, suffix)\n}\n\n# date associated with each file\nurl_dates &lt;- as.Date(gsub(\".*(\\\\d{8})\\\\d{6}.*\", \"\\\\1\", urls), format=\"%Y%m%d\")\n\nBecause each file in this list of URLs has the same spatial extent, resolution, and projection, we can now manually construct our space-time data cube from these netcdf slices:\n\ndata_gd &lt;- gdalcubes::stack_cube(vrt(urls), datetime_values = url_dates)\n\nWe use gdalcubes to crop each file\n\nextent = list(left=-93, right=-76, bottom=41, top=49,\n              t0=start, t1=end)\n\nbench::bench_time({\n  data_gd |&gt; \n    gdalcubes::crop(extent) |&gt; \n    aggregate_time(dt=\"P3D\", method=\"mean\") |&gt; \n    plot(col = viridisLite::viridis(10))\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess    real \n  2.29s  27.34s \n\n\n\n\n\nThe STAC Catalog search system we illustrated in the introductory example is a widely used standard. This means that we can use the same packages and same code we have already learned to access entirely different geospatial data products prepared by an entirely different provider. In this example, we will illustrate searching NASA’s EarthData catalog using the STAC interface. We can also browse the collection of NASA Earthdata STAC Catalogs in a web browser. (NOTE: Unfortunately, at this time, NASA’s implementation of the STAC standard is incomplete. The web browser only shows the first 10 entries under any heading, despite the NASA STAC API actually having the complete records. Also, NASA’s STAC service is considerably slower than those provided by Element84 or Microsoft Planetary Computer.)\n\nitems &lt;- stac(\"https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/POCLOUD\") |&gt; \n  stac_search(collections = \"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n              datetime = paste(start,end, sep = \"/\")) |&gt;\n  post_request() |&gt;\n  items_fetch()\n\nitems\n\n###STACItemCollection\n- matched feature(s): 3\n- features (3 item(s) / 0 not fetched):\n  - 20200101090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n  - 20200102090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n  - 20200103090000-JPL-L4_GHRSST-SSTfnd-MUR-GLOB-v02.0-fv04.1\n- assets: data, metadata, opendap\n- item's fields: \nassets, bbox, collection, geometry, id, links, properties, stac_extensions, stac_version, type",

    "text": "Courses involving computer programming frequently start with control structures and data structures. Extensive education research has underscored the value in starting with visualization. Visualization offers ‘early wins’, producing something that is compelling and often fun. Like many of our skills, we will continue to refine and extend our knowledge of data visualization throughout each stage of the course, Mastery comes through repetition.\n\n\nThe seaborn Object Interface implements the Grammar of Graphics in python. This approach to data visualization provides a powerful abstraction around data visualization concepts. The theory has been around for a long time, but has become mainstream in data science through the work of Hadley Wickham and ggplot2 implementation in R. Python libraries have only begun to adopt this concept more recently, but it can now be found in many python visualization libraries, including plotnine, altair, and seaborn’s object interface.[^1]\n[1]: Choosing packages is an important but tricky question. Many academic courses pretend to dismiss the issue, arguing that if students learn the fundamental principles, they will always be able to use the whatever package is fashionable at the time. There is some truth to this, but ignores obvious realities in the learning experience. The large, decentralized and rapidly moving landscape of python nevertheless makes this choice difficult, especially in comparison to the R language, where for the past decade at least, a single company with intense focus on pedagogy and predictable standards have created and promoted the tightly integrated and widely adoptied tidyverse. Of those mentioned implementing a grammar of graphics: plotnine is nearly-identical translation of the ggplot2 syntax into python. It has only the core functionality of ggplot2 and a smaller user community. altair provides python bindings to the popular vega library in javascript which also implementing the grammar of graphics, and can be particularly useful in generating dashboards where interactive javascript can enrich the design. seaborn is already a popular within the Python community, and it’s recently added object-oriented syntax provides a more ‘pythonic’ design than the aforementioned examples built around the syntax of other languages.\nThe fundemental principle of the grammar of graphics is that it expresses mappings from data to aesthetics of a graph (color, size, x/y position, etc). For instance, different colors are often used in graphs to indicate different groups:\n\nimport ibis\ndf = ibis.read_csv(\"../data/co2.csv\")\ndf.to_pandas()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndecimal_date\nname\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\n1958.2027\nco2\n315.71\n\n\n1\n1958.2027\nsmooth\n314.44\n\n\n2\n1958.2877\nco2\n317.45\n\n\n3\n1958.2877\nsmooth\n315.16\n\n\n4\n1958.3699\nco2\n317.51\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n1589\n2024.3750\nsmooth\n423.61\n\n\n1590\n2024.4583\nco2\n426.91\n\n\n1591\n2024.4583\nsmooth\n424.44\n\n\n1592\n2024.5417\nco2\n425.55\n\n\n1593\n2024.5417\nsmooth\n425.10\n\n\n\n\n1594 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nThe grammar of graphics always maps data (i.e. columns) to abstract aesthetics. For instance, the categorical values in the “name” column can be mapped to indicate the color:\n\n# Modern\nimport seaborn.objects as so\n(\n    so.Plot(df, x = 'decimal_date', y='value', color=\"name\")\n    .add(so.Line())\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany early plotting engines such as matplotlib and even the original seaborn do not fully reflect these principles. Learning the grammar makes it much easier to make and modify complex charts, while also encouraging best-practices such as tidy data and semantic code. Contrast this code with an alternative syntax that specifies the color manually:\n\n# Example of older verbose code\nimport seaborn as sns\ndf1 = df.pivot_wider()\nsns.lineplot(df1, x=\"decimal_date\", y = \"co2\", color=\"blue\")\nsns.lineplot(df1, x=\"decimal_date\", y = \"smooth\", color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this syntax, x and y still refer to columns of the data, but color is asserted manually. The relationship between color and data structure is not captured here. If we wanted to use a different color scheme, we would have to manually update each assertion. This is harder to generalize and more error-prone. Note also that while this approach is somewhat more concise for a single x/y line, it quickly becomes more verbose, repeating many parts that do not need repeating in the previous approach. We will avoid this older syntax.\nIn this example we can spot other advantages as well, such as default color theme informed by visualization research, and syntax that encourages the use of “tidy” data, in which columns represent variables and rows represent observations. This is sometimes called ‘long’ form, and more formally known as Cobb’s Third Normal Form. This format takes some getting used to, and frequently requires some transformation or ‘tidying’ to achieve, since many wild-caught data examples do not follow this best practice, especially older and smaller datasets.

    "text": "We will be focusing on how to use the ibis package, a successor to the popular pandas package, for manipulating tabular data. We begin by importing the ibis package. (We include two additional imports from the package which are commonly referred to using their short names, the table placeholder _ instead of ibis._, and the selectors methods as s instead of the verbose ibis.selectors. We will see these in action later).\n\nLearning Goals\n\nestablish a connection with duckdb.connect()\nuse head() and excute() to preview large data\nuse select(), distinct(), filter() to explore data.\n\n\n\nGetting started\nTo use ibis, we must also select a backend. We will always be using the quite new and very powerful duckdb backend for all of our tasks. We select a backend by creating a “connection”. The details here are not important for us, we can treat this first block as “boilerplate” starting code.\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\nimport ibis.selectors as s\n\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect()\n\nWe are now ready to read in our data. We will begin by reading the metrics table from the direct access link, as indicated in the URL below. con.read_csv() is quite similar to the pandas.read_csv() we saw in module 1, though the optional arguments get some different names and are not quite as flexibile. One important option for our purposes will be the how to indicate missing values. In the past, we’ve seen negative values like -99 be used to indicate missing values. That convention reflects limitations of early software, which had no natural concept of “missing”. More modern conventions indicating missing values as “NULL” or “NA”. We indicate the data has chosen the latter:\n\nmetrics_url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/cboettig/ram_fisheries/resolve/main/v4.65/tsmetrics.csv\"\ntsmetrics = con.read_csv(metrics_url, nullstr=\"NA\")\n\n\n\nPreviewing data: head() and execute()\nLet’s take a look at our new table:\n\ntsmetrics\n\nDatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_lnkh36a47bbdhi4vbfj7tetgry\n  tscategory   string\n  tsshort      string\n  tslong       string\n  tsunitsshort string\n  tsunitslong  string\n  tsunique     string\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t look like a pretty pandas table! Where are the values? Actually, as we become more familiar with ibis we learn to appreciate the display choice here. ibis is designed for working with very big data. An important part of this is something called lazy evaluation. Even downloading a very large fle might take a long time, and trying to load a large dataset into python all at once can exceed available RAM and crash the kernel. Instead, ibis merely “peeks” at the data over the remote connection – without even downloading it! It tells us the names of each column and the data type (e.g. string, or numeric, etc) that the read_csv method has ‘guessed’ for the data. As we will see, this is often the most useful information anway.\nIf we we do want to see a few example rows, we can use the method head() on the table, tsmetrics.head(), to say we want only want to see the top of the data frame. Optionally we can specify how many rows we want to preview, e.g. tsmetrics.head(10) to see 10 (the default is 5). Let’s try it:\n\ntsmetrics.head()\n\nr0 := DatabaseTable: ibis_read_csv_lnkh36a47bbdhi4vbfj7tetgry\n  tscategory   string\n  tsshort      string\n  tslong       string\n  tsunitsshort string\n  tsunitslong  string\n  tsunique     string\n\nLimit[r0, n=5]\n\n\n\nThat’s not the top of 5 rows! Once again, ibis is being lazy. We see the same definition of the table as before, only this time it has a name r0, and we see a “plan of execution”, that ibis will return the first 5 rows Limit[r0, 5]. We can force it to execute this plan with execute() :\n\ntsmetrics.head().execute()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\ntsshort\ntslong\ntsunitsshort\ntsunitslong\ntsunique\n\n\n\n\n0\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\nAQ\nAquaculture\nMT\nmetric tons\nAQ-MT\n\n\n1\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\nASP\nAnnual surplus production\nMT\nMetric tons\nASP-MT\n\n\n2\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmgtpref\nGeneral biomass time series preferentially rel...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmgtpref-dimensionless\n\n\n3\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmgttouse\nGeneral biomass time series relative to manage...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmgttouse-dimensionless\n\n\n4\nTOTAL BIOMASS\nBdivBmsypref\nGeneral biomass time series preferentially rel...\ndimensionless\ndimensionless\nBdivBmsypref-dimensionless\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt last, we are starting to see what the data really looks like. Data tables can quickly become much to large to explore by simply trying to eyeball every row. For instance, we notice the first column, tscategory, shows a few different possible categories for the various metrics in the database. So, how many distinct categories are there?\n\n\nselect() and distinct()\nTo answer this, we will introduce a few more methods of data table manipulation. select() selects one or more columns of a given table, while distinct() returns only distinct (unique) rows of the table. Note that both of these methods share a common pattern – they both apply to a table (not some piece of a table, like a row or column or cell), and they both return a new table as well that is some subset of the old table. table in, table out. This design is very intentional – by having methods designed specificially to operate on tables and return tables, we can easily stack or chain these together, (also true of head() and execute()`. So let’s try and see distinct categories:\n\n(tsmetrics\n .select(\"tscategory\")\n .distinct()\n .head(10)\n .execute()\n)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\n\n\n\n\n0\nOTHER TIME SERIES DATA\n\n\n1\nSPAWNING STOCK BIOMASS or CPUE\n\n\n2\nPRODUCTION\n\n\n3\nTOTAL BIOMASS\n\n\n4\nRECRUITS (NOTE: RECRUITS ARE OFFSET IN TIME SE...\n\n\n5\nTIME UNITS\n\n\n6\nCATCH or LANDINGS\n\n\n7\nFISHING MORTALITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have stacked these methods together with each step on it’s own line by wrapping the whole thing inside () parentheses. This can make a long “chain” of commands easier to read. While we have asked for no more that 10 values, we have gotten back only 8 – so we now know there are only 8 categories.\n\n\nfilter()\nWhat are the different unit types within, say, the “CATCH or LANDINGS” category? This requires a subset of rows (a filter), rather than a subset of columns (select()):\n\n(tsmetrics\n .filter(_.tscategory == \"CATCH or LANDINGS\")\n .distinct()\n .head(14)\n .execute()\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntscategory\ntsshort\ntslong\ntsunitsshort\ntsunitslong\ntsunique\n\n\n\n\n0\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nCdivMSY-conv\nCatch divided by MSY calculated from converted...\nratio\nratio\nCdivMSY-conv-ratio\n\n\n1\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nCdivMSY\nCatch divided by MSY\nratio\nratio\nCdivMSY-ratio\n\n\n2\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nTAC-A2\nTotal allowable catch In subarea\nMT\nMetric tons\nTAC-A2-MT\n\n\n3\nCATCH or LANDINGS\nTC-3\nTotal catch.

This is actually a shorthand for the pattern tsmetrics.tscategory – the _ is a placeholder for “the current table” in our chain. Extracting a single column with . is itself something of a shorthand, it is equivalent to using the selector [, as tsmetrics[\"category\"]. When a column name is also the name of a table method, we may need to fall back on the square bracket convention. So why use a dot at all? In addition to taking two less characters to write, the . method allows “tab completion” of the column name, which helps us avoid typos. Note that our select() method recognizes either syntax, you can do: tsmetrics.select(_.tscategory). This looks slightly more cryptic, but benefits from autocomplete and matches the sytnax of other functions.\n\n\n== not =\nAnother common mistake is to use a single = sign rather than == in filter. Recall that = is used in variable assignment, a = 1 sets the value of a as 1. Double-equals is a “boolean operator”, that tests if the statement is True or False:\n\na = 1\na == 1\n\nTrue\n\n\nOther boolean operators include &gt;, &gt;=, != (not equal) and so forth. The important thing is to know that we can do boolean comparisons, this syntax is easy to look up.\n\n\n\nNext steps\nExplore the datasets in this collection using select(), distinct() and filter(). We will return to this list of Catch units after we become more aquainted with the remaining tables.\nThis syntax is harder than select() – we can’t just filter for “CATCH or LANDINGS” without indicating which column we are looking in. To signal that tscategory is a column name and not just a piece of text, we use the subsetting notation, _.tscategory. This is merely a shorthand for the more verbose:",

    "text": "In this section, we will explore various spatial data formats, operations, and visualization methods. As before, there is large landscape of tools and platforms designed to work for spatial data. We will be focusing on a subset of tools now emerging at the leading edge of cloud-native geospatial computing.\nGeospatial computation can be divided into three components:\n\nData I/O (input/output)\nData manipulation / analysis\nData visualization\n\n\n\nWe divide geospatial data1 into two broad classes of data:\n\nraster data\nvector data\n\nRaster data, also called “image” data or gridded data are made up of pixels.

Spatial vector data can be found in a bewildering array of formats or file types (or “serializations”). Because some common platforms can only understand a few of these formats, it is not uncommon to see spatial data providers offer the same data in multile formats. Fortunately for us can more-or-less all be read in the same way.\nJust as pandas has historically been the go-to for reading in tabular data, geopandas is the most common mechanism for reading spatial data into python. Built on top of pandas, it faces the same limitations, especially when it comes to very big geospatial data. Rather than teaching you different tools to work with ‘small’ and ‘big’ data, thanks to recent innovations we will be able to start off learning the faster, more scalable ‘big data’ solutions provided by duckdb and accessible to us in ibis.\nLet’s begin by looking at the redlining data from the Mapping Inequality Project, https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/data. This data provider offers the ability to “download” the data in either format. ibis 2 can read either one, and can do so both directly from the URL and without downloading the entire file. Use a two-finger click on the download button to copy-paste the download URL into your notebook, like so:\n\n%%time\nredlines = con.read_geo(\"/vsicurl/https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n\nCPU times: user 542 ms, sys: 110 ms, total: 653 ms\nWall time: 1.67 s\n\n\nNote how we have added the prefix /vsicurl/ in the URL. This signifies to the underlying software (GDAL) that we wish to use the virtual system interface to access this url, i.e. rather than first copying the file to the local machine, we access just the bytes we need over ‘range requests’. Previously we have seen ibis do this ‘range request’ trick automatically on URLs for text-based data, and in future this explicit prefix may not be necessary here either.\n\n#%%time\n#without_vsi = con.read_geo(\"https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n\nWe can now use our ibis functions to explore this data.

Unlike computer graphics formats which typically represent images in a ‘flat’ (Euclidian) geometry, geospatial data must contend with the curvature of the earth using an explicit notion of coordinate reference systems. We will have more to say about this later.↩︎\nGood abstractions are at the core of good software design. ibis isn’t really doing the heavy lifting here, it is merely providing a user-friendly ‘pythonic’ interface to many different “backends” that perform the actual computation. Only one of those, duckdb, is providing the spatial abilities we need. When it comes to reading different file formats, duckdb achieves this only by calling out to another piece of software, GDAL, which has been around a lot longer and can be found under the hood of a great many geospatial data tools, from python packages like geopandas to QGIS to Google Earth Engine.↩︎\nsome additional methods are possible in the underlying duckdb spatial extension but do not yet have bindings in ibis. ibis provides an extension syntax that allows users to invoke these methods.↩︎",

    "text": "In this section we turn to raster data, specifically, to satellite imagery. To get started, we must select an “area of interest” where we want to study – in our case, the bounding box around the redlining polygons of whichever city we have chosen. Given a geopandas data frame of our city, we can extract the bounding box in using the .total_bounds() method1\n\nimport ibis\nfrom ibis import _\ncon = ibis.duckdb.connect(extensions=[\"spatial\"])\n\nredlines = (\n    con\n    .read_geo(\"/vsicurl/https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/static/mappinginequality.gpkg\")\n    .filter(_.city == \"New Haven\", _.residential)\n   )\ncity =  redlines.execute()\nbox = city.total_bounds\nbox\n\n\n\n\narray([-72.99321,  41.23109, -72.85227,  41.37502])\n\n\n\n\nWorking with raster data will take us beyond the tabular data model we have been using so far with ibis into another data model, known in some communities as “raster” data and others as “M-dimensional array data”. Consequently, we will be introducing a suite of new packages for working with kind of data. To help associate the different new python packages with there roles in this data pipeline, I will be adding the import commands as we go along, rather than all at once.\nWe begin by searching for relevant satellite imagery using a Spatio-Temporal Assets Catalog (STAC). A STAC catalog lets us search for all data in a particular collection that corresponds to a certain place and time, and potentionally other criteria noted in the catalog description. The python module pystac_client can automate this search process for us. Here, we search for all data assets in the “Sentinel-2 Level 2a” catalogue of publicly hosted data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which:\n\nfalls within our bounding box\noccurs in the most recent summer months (we want to measure greenness when leaves are on the trees)\nhas less than 20% of the image obscured by clouds\n\nAt this stage, we are only reading the STAC data catalog using pystac_client, not touching any of the actual data files. Our goal is to narrow down to the URLs of just those assets we need, rather than downloading lots of data that won’t end up in our analysis. This approach is a core element of a ‘cloud native’ workflow.\n\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n\n\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2024-06-01/2024-09-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\nLet’s take a look at what

“features”, each corresponding to a different time the satellite has flown over and taken an image of our bounding box during the window described. Our search criteria have also excluded any images taken during that interval that have more than 20% cloud cover. You may need to adjust the cloud cover filter or the date range to recover a handful of images. We need at least one, but preferably a few different images to get an accurate estimate of the greenness during summer months. Too many images, however, can just bog things down with exta calculations. If you have more than 4 or 5 images, consider a stricter cloud requirement or a narrower date range to filter down your results.\nClick on the arrows above to drill down into the list of features returned like so:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nWithin each “feature” we find detailed metadata about the data contained. The spatial extent of the image appears in the “geometry”, while date and other information appear under “properties” In the “assets” element, we finally find a list of all the individual data files associated with this feature – primarily specific “bands” or wavelengths of light that the cameras on board the satellite are able to detect. While cameras in smart-phones (and most small commericial cube-sats) can only see Red, Green, and Blue, the sensors on board Sentinel-2 can see in quite a lot more wavelengths. A URL points to the specific TIF file containing the data for each wavelength.\n\n\n\nRather than work our way though all this metadata manually, we will now draw upon another package that is capable of understanding the information returned by the STAC catalog and helping us access only the parts we need, without downloading entire assets. Historically this kind of trick was only done with specialized systems and powerful computers such as Google Earth Engine. Today, open source tools in python make many of the same operations possible with greater flexibility and control. This approach is fundamental to scalable ‘cloud-native’ analysis of massive satellite data.\nOur next step uses a package called odc.stac to load just the two spectral bands of interest for us, and access only those parts of each file that correspond to our area of interest. We will only scratch the surface of odc.stac tooling here, but more details can be found in the odc.stac documentation.\n\nimport odc.stac\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    bbox=box,\n    resolution=10, # the native resolution is already 10m.

For large city areas like Los Angeles that need multiple images to tile, consider reducing this resolution, e.g. to 100m, to improve overall performance. Using chunking (chunks={}) and grouping (e.g. groupby=\"solar_day\") also help scaling to larger image collections by breaking the processing into smaller steps.\n\n\n\nThe most common metric of “greeness” (i.e. vegetation cover) for satellite imagery is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI (see link for details). Plants are green because they obsorb red light, while reflecting near-infrared. NDVI compares the difference between these two band intensities to the sum:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED} \\]\nThis creates a ‘normalized’ index that should be between -1 (water) and 1 (maximum vegitation). xarray makes it easy to compute operations on different bands (variables), e.g. we can compute the difference between each \\((X, Y, Time)\\) coordinate in the NIR wavelength to thhat of the red wavelength as data.nir08 - data.red. We can also compute summary statistics across dimensions. Here, becuase we have 4 different timepoints, we will take the median measurement over time – a common summary statistic that is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Lastly, we will drop any “bad” pixels, where the NDVI value is greater than 1.\n\nndvi = (\n    ((data.nir08 - data.red) / (data.red + data.nir08))\n    .median(\"time\", keep_attrs=True)\n)\n\nndvi = ndvi.where(ndvi &lt; 1).compute()\n\n\nndvi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray (y: 1627, x: 1220)&gt; Size: 16MB\narray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 13kB 4.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06 4.566e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 10kB 6.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05 6.8e+05\n    spatial_ref  int32 4B 32618xarray.DataArrayy: 1627x: 12200.8859 0.8805 0.8716 0.9001 0.8955 0.9044 ... nan nan nan nan nan nanarray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])Coordinates: (3)y(y)float644.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06units :metreresolution :-10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([4582615., 4582605., 4582595., ..., 4566375., 4566365., 4566355.])x(x)float646.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05units :metreresolution :10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([667815., 667825., 667835., ..., 679985., 679995., 680005.])spatial_ref()int3232618spatial_ref :PROJCRS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N\",BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],ID[\"EPSG\",4326]],CONVERSION[\"UTM zone 18N\",METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",-75,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",0.9996,SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],PARAMETER[\"False easting\",500000,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],PARAMETER[\"False northing\",0,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],CS[Cartesian,2],AXIS[\"(E)\",east,ORDER[1],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],AXIS[\"(N)\",north,ORDER[2],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],USAGE[SCOPE[\"Navigation and medium accuracy spatial referencing.\"],AREA[\"Between 78°W and 72°W, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

While it is possible to construct reasonably nice static map images with sufficient effort in this way, that approach is neither as user-friendly or as powerful as the more general interactive (javascript-based) maps generated by leafmap, so we won’t worry too much about styling. However, .plot.imshow() can be a convenient way to check what an xarray dataset looks like during the analysis process.\n\nndvi.plot.imshow()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo visualize our dervied data on an interactive map or share it with other researchers, we need to be able to export it to a file. One of the best choices for this purpose is a format referred to as “Cloud Optimized GeoTiff”, or “COG” for short. A COG file embeds multiple “zooms” and internal tiles, allowing it be rendered rapidly in visualizations. COG data files still preserve the numerical values of each pixel and associated metadata, making them useful for further computations. We will take advantage of this latter feature in seeking to summarize the average greeness in each polygon in our redlining data. The rioxarray package provides convenient utilities for input and output (io) between raster files and xarray data structures in python.\n\nimport rioxarray\n(ndvi\n .rio.reproject(\"EPSG:4326\")\n .rio.to_raster(raster_path=\"ndvi.tif\", \n                driver=\"COG\")   \n)\n\nSide note: optionally, we can also store a copy of our vector data, also setting the projection. Common formats include geopackage, .gpkg, and .parquet.\n\n(city\n .set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\")\n .to_file(\"new_haven.gpkg\") # common open standard\n)\n\n\n# latest option, best performance but less widely known:\ncity.set_crs(\"EPSG:4326\").to_parquet(\"new_haven.parquet\")",

    "text": "Working with raster data will take us beyond the tabular data model we have been using so far with ibis into another data model, known in some communities as “raster” data and others as “M-dimensional array data”. Consequently, we will be introducing a suite of new packages for working with kind of data. To help associate the different new python packages with there roles in this data pipeline, I will be adding the import commands as we go along, rather than all at once.\nWe begin by searching for relevant satellite imagery using a Spatio-Temporal Assets Catalog (STAC). A STAC catalog lets us search for all data in a particular collection that corresponds to a certain place and time, and potentionally other criteria noted in the catalog description. The python module pystac_client can automate this search process for us. Here, we search for all data assets in the “Sentinel-2 Level 2a” catalogue of publicly hosted data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) which:\n\nfalls within our bounding box\noccurs in the most recent summer months (we want to measure greenness when leaves are on the trees)\nhas less than 20% of the image obscured by clouds\n\nAt this stage, we are only reading the STAC data catalog using pystac_client, not touching any of the actual data files. Our goal is to narrow down to the URLs of just those assets we need, rather than downloading lots of data that won’t end up in our analysis. This approach is a core element of a ‘cloud native’ workflow.\n\nfrom pystac_client import Client\n\n\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2024-06-01/2024-09-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\nLet’s take a look at what

“features”, each corresponding to a different time the satellite has flown over and taken an image of our bounding box during the window described. Our search criteria have also excluded any images taken during that interval that have more than 20% cloud cover. You may need to adjust the cloud cover filter or the date range to recover a handful of images. We need at least one, but preferably a few different images to get an accurate estimate of the greenness during summer months. Too many images, however, can just bog things down with exta calculations. If you have more than 4 or 5 images, consider a stricter cloud requirement or a narrower date range to filter down your results.\nClick on the arrows above to drill down into the list of features returned like so:\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\nWithin each “feature” we find detailed metadata about the data contained. The spatial extent of the image appears in the “geometry”, while date and other information appear under “properties” In the “assets” element, we finally find a list of all the individual data files associated with this feature – primarily specific “bands” or wavelengths of light that the cameras on board the satellite are able to detect. While cameras in smart-phones (and most small commericial cube-sats) can only see Red, Green, and Blue, the sensors on board Sentinel-2 can see in quite a lot more wavelengths. A URL points to the specific TIF file containing the data for each wavelength.",

    "text": "Rather than work our way though all this metadata manually, we will now draw upon another package that is capable of understanding the information returned by the STAC catalog and helping us access only the parts we need, without downloading entire assets. Historically this kind of trick was only done with specialized systems and powerful computers such as Google Earth Engine. Today, open source tools in python make many of the same operations possible with greater flexibility and control. This approach is fundamental to scalable ‘cloud-native’ analysis of massive satellite data.\nOur next step uses a package called odc.stac to load just the two spectral bands of interest for us, and access only those parts of each file that correspond to our area of interest. We will only scratch the surface of odc.stac tooling here, but more details can be found in the odc.stac documentation.\n\nimport odc.stac\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    bbox=box,\n    resolution=10, # the native resolution is already 10m.

    "text": "The most common metric of “greeness” (i.e. vegetation cover) for satellite imagery is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, or NDVI (see link for details). Plants are green because they obsorb red light, while reflecting near-infrared. NDVI compares the difference between these two band intensities to the sum:\n\\[ NDVI = \\frac{NIR - RED}{NIR + RED} \\]\nThis creates a ‘normalized’ index that should be between -1 (water) and 1 (maximum vegitation). xarray makes it easy to compute operations on different bands (variables), e.g. we can compute the difference between each \\((X, Y, Time)\\) coordinate in the NIR wavelength to thhat of the red wavelength as data.nir08 - data.red. We can also compute summary statistics across dimensions. Here, becuase we have 4 different timepoints, we will take the median measurement over time – a common summary statistic that is less sensitive to outliers than the mean. Lastly, we will drop any “bad” pixels, where the NDVI value is greater than 1.\n\nndvi = (\n    ((data.nir08 - data.red) / (data.red + data.nir08))\n    .median(\"time\", keep_attrs=True)\n)\n\nndvi = ndvi.where(ndvi &lt; 1).compute()\n\n\nndvi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;xarray.DataArray (y: 1627, x: 1220)&gt; Size: 16MB\narray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])\nCoordinates:\n  * y            (y) float64 13kB 4.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06 4.566e+06\n  * x            (x) float64 10kB 6.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05 6.8e+05\n    spatial_ref  int32 4B 32618xarray.DataArrayy: 1627x: 12200.8859 0.8805 0.8716 0.9001 0.8955 0.9044 ... nan nan nan nan nan nanarray([[0.88591885, 0.88051675, 0.87161283, ..., 0.85875371, 0.84881165,\n        0.86324397],\n       [0.85873743, 0.88231669, 0.90861641, ..., 0.75906042, 0.82126435,\n        0.84697593],\n       [0.84439895, 0.88673668, 0.89681533, ..., 0.77134877, 0.82810371,\n        0.84242071],\n       ...,\n       [0.81399746, 0.45830669, 0.36016143, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.8458809 , 0.48283024, 0.41006737, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan],\n       [0.82337862, 0.4601535 , 0.44678909, ...,        nan,        nan,\n               nan]])Coordinates: (3)y(y)float644.583e+06 4.583e+06 ... 4.566e+06units :metreresolution :-10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([4582615., 4582605., 4582595., ..., 4566375., 4566365., 4566355.])x(x)float646.678e+05 6.678e+05 ... 6.8e+05units :metreresolution :10.0crs :EPSG:32618array([667815., 667825., 667835., ..., 679985., 679995., 680005.])spatial_ref()int3232618spatial_ref :PROJCRS[\"WGS 84 / UTM zone 18N\",BASEGEOGCRS[\"WGS 84\",ENSEMBLE[\"World Geodetic System 1984 ensemble\",MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (Transit)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G730)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G873)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1150)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1674)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G1762)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2139)\"],MEMBER[\"World Geodetic System 1984 (G2296)\"],ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],ENSEMBLEACCURACY[2.0]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],ID[\"EPSG\",4326]],CONVERSION[\"UTM zone 18N\",METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",0,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",-75,ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",0.9996,SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],PARAMETER[\"False easting\",500000,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],PARAMETER[\"False northing\",0,LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],CS[Cartesian,2],AXIS[\"(E)\",east,ORDER[1],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],AXIS[\"(N)\",north,ORDER[2],LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],USAGE[SCOPE[\"Navigation and medium accuracy spatial referencing.\"],AREA[\"Between 78°W and 72°W, northern hemisphere between equator and 84°N, onshore and offshore.

While it is possible to construct reasonably nice static map images with sufficient effort in this way, that approach is neither as user-friendly or as powerful as the more general interactive (javascript-based) maps generated by leafmap, so we won’t worry too much about styling. However, .plot.imshow() can be a convenient way to check what an xarray dataset looks like during the analysis process.\n\nndvi.plot.imshow()",

    "text": "To visualize our dervied data on an interactive map or share it with other researchers, we need to be able to export it to a file. One of the best choices for this purpose is a format referred to as “Cloud Optimized GeoTiff”, or “COG” for short. A COG file embeds multiple “zooms” and internal tiles, allowing it be rendered rapidly in visualizations. COG data files still preserve the numerical values of each pixel and associated metadata, making them useful for further computations. We will take advantage of this latter feature in seeking to summarize the average greeness in each polygon in our redlining data. The rioxarray package provides convenient utilities for input and output (io) between raster files and xarray data structures in python.\n\nimport rioxarray\n(ndvi\n .rio.reproject(\"EPSG:4326\")\n .rio.to_raster(raster_path=\"ndvi.tif\", \n                driver=\"COG\")   \n)\n\nSide note: optionally, we can also store a copy of our vector data, also setting the projection.

Many of these opinions are anchored in deeply researched pedagogy and experience, some are not.\nAfter seven years of teaching in R, this version of the course is taught in Python. The R community has benefitted tremendously in recent years from an close-knit, inclusive and welcoming community of instructors and software developers, including a notable committment to learning and pegagogy from the company formerly known as RStudio its team of open source developers of the “tidyverse” under Hadley Wickham. Jenny Bryan (Statistics professor from UBC and a developer at RStudio) became an internet sensation for her ground-breaking open course, STAT-545, which heavily influenced the early development of ESPM-157 and many similar courses in R, which among other things helped pioneer teaching GitHub ‘from day 1’ and led to the creation of https://happygitwithr.com.\n\nIt’s Abstractions All the Way Down, JD Long, Posit-Conf 2023.\n\nAdditional reading\n\nData Science Lifecycle in DS100 book, Learning Data Science By Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan.\nIntro in R for Data Science\n\nR4DS view:\n\nThe DS100 view of data cycle",

Sometimes it may be necessary to install specific libraries or specific versions of those libraries. And for fastest setup and maximum reproducibility, users can deploy the fully containerized environment.

Codespaces has a free tier of 60 hours/month, Gitpod of 50 hours a month, both offer paid plans for additional use and larger compute instances. Small codespace instances are also free to instructors\nBy clicking on one of the buttons in GitHub, users will be placed into a free cloud-based virtual machine running a VSCode editor in their web browser. The first setup can take a few minutes to complete.\nAdditionally, this also provides access to an RStudio environment on an embedded port for users who prefer that editor to VSCode. Once the Codespace has fully completed loading, it will include a link in a second welcome message in the Terminal to access RStudio like so:\n\nThe RStudio link can also always be accessed from the Ports tab under the port labeled “Rstudio” (8787). (Gitpod will show a pop-up message to open this port instead.)\nBoth Codespaces and Gitpod can be configured with custom compute environments by supplying a docker image. Both the VSCode and RStudio editors run in the same underlying custom Docker container. This repository includes a Dockerfile defining this compute environment which includes specific versions of R and python packages, the latest releases of the OSGeo C libraries GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS that power many spatial operations in both languages. These elements are pre-compiled in a Docker container based on the latest Ubuntu LTS release (22.04 at the time of writing), which itself is build according to the Dockerfile found in this repository using a GitHub Action. The devcontainer.json configuration will also set up relevant VSCode extensions for both both Jupyter and Quarto notebooks, with each supporting both R and Python.\n\n\n\nOpen this repository in a local Visual Studio Code editor on a Mac, Linux, or Windows laptop and you will probably be prompted “Do you want to open this in project in a Dev Container?” If you agree, VSCode will attempt to use a local Docker installation to pull a container with much of the required software already installed. This uses the same Docker container and enables all the same extensions in VSCode, including RStudio server on the embedded port.\nOf course, users can open this project in a local VSCode or any other favorite editor without opening in the devcontainer. The user assumes responsibility to install necessary software, i.e. the packages listed in requirements.txt or install.R. Note that doing so does not ensure that the same version of system libraries like GDAL, PROJ, or GEOS will necessarily be used. For most operations this should not matter, but users on older versions of GDAL may encounter worse performance or other difficulties.\n\n\n\nWe can sidesteps elements specific to the VSCode editor defined in the devcontainer.json configuration while still leveraging the same system libraries and pre-built packages. For example, a user could also choose to run (or extend) the underlying docker container independently, e.g.\ndocker run --rm -ti ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/nasa-tops:latest bash\nwhich opens a bash terminal inside the container. This approach is also compatible with most HPC setups using singularity instead of docker.\nSome users may not be familiar with editing and running code entirely from a bash shell, so the container also includes RStudio server and thus can be run to launch RStudio in an open port instead,\ndocker run -d -p 8787:8787 --user root -e DISABLE_AUTH=true \\\n  ghcr.io/boettiger-lab/nasa-tops:latest\nand visit http://localhost:8787 to connect.",

    "text": "This project seeks to introduce cloud-native approaches to geospatial analysis in R & Python through the lens of environmental justice applications. This is not meant as a complete course in geospatial analysis – though we encourage interested readers to consider Geocomputation in R or Python as an excellent resource. We present opinionated recipes meant to empower users with the following design goals:\n\nOpen science: open source software, open data, open standards, and reproducibility are emphasized.\nRecipes are presented as reproducible computational notebooks (Quarto and Jupyter) set in narrative analysis.\nAccess to cloud-based compute is not required. The high speed networks of commercial cloud providers can accelerate network-bound operations, but can run from anywhere.\nAccess to a powerful laptop or desktop is not required either. Examples can run from a browser interface on free compute resources such as Codespaces.\nPortable software environments: a Docker container with precise software used to produce these examples. The container is build from the included Dockerfile using the included GitHub Action and is deployed by the Codespaces instance.\nAlignment between R and Python: recipes will try to show approaches in both languages and seek to utilize common interfaces (such as STAC and GDAL) that can be shared across these platforms.\n\nThis is a work in progress! Check back often, and feedback welcome! Test these modules, file an issue or pull request, launch into a Codespaces environment, or reach out on the discussion board.\nWhat is “cloud-native” anyway? We define cloud-native to mean simply that data is accessed over http range request methods, rather than downloading entire files. Code-based examples will develop why this is important and how it differs from renting cloud-based compute. The core philosophy is that what many users already know how to do locally translates pretty seamlessly here, and then a bit extra is required to coerce certain software to stay in ‘range request’ mode and not get greedy trying to download everything. Some authors define this concept somewhat differently, and certainly not all range requests give the same performance, nor are http range requests best in all cases.\n\n\nThanks to input, suggestions, feedback and ideas from so many amazing folks in the OpenScapes community and input and financial support from the NASA TOPS community.",

We can then issue the usual xarray operations to process and plot the data, treating the remote source as if it were already sitting on our local disk. This approach is quite fast, works from any machine, and does not require spending money on AWS.

    "text": "This executable notebook provides an opening example to illustrate a cloud-native workflow in both R and python. Pedagogy research emphasizes the importance of “playing the whole game” before breaking down every pitch and hit. We intentionally focus on powerful high-level tools (STAC API, COGs, datacubes) to illustrate how a few chunks of code can perform a task that would be far slower and more verbose in a traditional file-based, download-first workflow. Note the close parallels between R and Python syntax. This arises because both languages wrap the same underlying tools (the STAC API and GDAL warper) and handle many of the nuisances of spatial data – from re-projections and resampling to mosaic tiles – without us noticing.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ngdalcubes::gdalcubes_options(parallel = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nimport odc.stac\nimport rioxarray\nfrom pystac_client import Client\nimport geopandas as gpd\nfrom rasterstats import zonal_stats \n\n\nimport dask.distributed\nclient = dask.distributed.Client()\n\n/opt/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/distributed/node.py:182: UserWarning: Port 8787 is already in use.\nPerhaps you already have a cluster running?\nHosting the HTTP server on port 34209 instead\n  warnings.warn(\n\nodc.stac.configure_rio(cloud_defaults=True, client=client)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in many workflows involves discovering individual spatial data files covering the space, time, and variables of interest. Here we use a STAC Catalog API to recover a list of candidate data. We dig deeper into how this works and what it returns in later recipes. This example searches for images in a lon-lat bounding box from a collection of Cloud-Optimized-GeoTIFF (COG) images taken by Sentinel2 satellite mission. This function will not download any imagery, it merely gives us a list of metadata about available images, including the access URLs.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nbox &lt;- c(xmin=-122.51, ymin=37.71, xmax=-122.36, ymax=37.81) \nstart_date &lt;- \"2022-06-01\"\nend_date &lt;- \"2022-08-01\"\nitems &lt;-\n  stac(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/\") |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs\",\n              bbox = box,\n              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep=\"/\"),\n              limit = 100) |&gt;\n  ext_query(\"eo:cloud_cover\" &lt; 20) |&gt;\n  post_request()\n\n\n\n\nbox = [-122.51, 37.71, -122.36, 37.81]\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2022-06-01/2022-08-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe pass this list of images to a high-level utilty (gdalcubes in R, odc.stac in python) that will do all of the heavy lifting. Using the URLs and metadata provided by STAC, these functions can extract only our data of interest (given by the bounding box) without downloading unnecessary regions or bands. While streaming the data, these functions will also reproject it into the desired coordinate reference system – (an often costly operation to perform in R) and can potentially resample or aggregate the data to a desired spatial resolution. (The R code will also resample from images in overlapping areas to replace pixels masked by clouds)\n\nRPython\n\n\n\ncol &lt;- stac_image_collection(items$features, asset_names = c(\"B08\", \"B04\", \"SCL\"))\n\ncube &lt;- cube_view(srs =\"EPSG:4326\",\n                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = end_date,\n                                left = box[1], right = box[3],\n                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),\n                  dx = 0.0001, dy = 0.0001, dt = \"P1D\",\n                  aggregation = \"median\", resampling = \"average\")\n\nmask &lt;- image_mask(\"SCL\", values=c(3, 8, 9)) # mask clouds and cloud shadows\n\ndata &lt;-  raster_cube(col, cube, mask = mask)\n\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    crs=\"EPSG:4326\",\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    resolution=0.0001,\n    bbox=box\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe can do arbitrary calculations on this data as well.

    "text": "The first step in many workflows involves discovering individual spatial data files covering the space, time, and variables of interest. Here we use a STAC Catalog API to recover a list of candidate data. We dig deeper into how this works and what it returns in later recipes. This example searches for images in a lon-lat bounding box from a collection of Cloud-Optimized-GeoTIFF (COG) images taken by Sentinel2 satellite mission. This function will not download any imagery, it merely gives us a list of metadata about available images, including the access URLs.\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nbox &lt;- c(xmin=-122.51, ymin=37.71, xmax=-122.36, ymax=37.81) \nstart_date &lt;- \"2022-06-01\"\nend_date &lt;- \"2022-08-01\"\nitems &lt;-\n  stac(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0/\") |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs\",\n              bbox = box,\n              datetime = paste(start_date, end_date, sep=\"/\"),\n              limit = 100) |&gt;\n  ext_query(\"eo:cloud_cover\" &lt; 20) |&gt;\n  post_request()\n\n\n\n\nbox = [-122.51, 37.71, -122.36, 37.81]\nitems = (\n  Client.\n  open(\"https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v1\").\n  search(\n    collections = ['sentinel-2-l2a'],\n    bbox = box,\n    datetime = \"2022-06-01/2022-08-01\",\n    query={\"eo:cloud_cover\": {\"lt\": 20}}).\n  item_collection()\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe pass this list of images to a high-level utilty (gdalcubes in R, odc.stac in python) that will do all of the heavy lifting. Using the URLs and metadata provided by STAC, these functions can extract only our data of interest (given by the bounding box) without downloading unnecessary regions or bands. While streaming the data, these functions will also reproject it into the desired coordinate reference system – (an often costly operation to perform in R) and can potentially resample or aggregate the data to a desired spatial resolution. (The R code will also resample from images in overlapping areas to replace pixels masked by clouds)\n\nRPython\n\n\n\ncol &lt;- stac_image_collection(items$features, asset_names = c(\"B08\", \"B04\", \"SCL\"))\n\ncube &lt;- cube_view(srs =\"EPSG:4326\",\n                  extent = list(t0 = start_date, t1 = end_date,\n                                left = box[1], right = box[3],\n                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),\n                  dx = 0.0001, dy = 0.0001, dt = \"P1D\",\n                  aggregation = \"median\", resampling = \"average\")\n\nmask &lt;- image_mask(\"SCL\", values=c(3, 8, 9)) # mask clouds and cloud shadows\n\ndata &lt;-  raster_cube(col, cube, mask = mask)\n\n\n\n\ndata = odc.stac.load(\n    items,\n    crs=\"EPSG:4326\",\n    bands=[\"nir08\", \"red\"],\n    resolution=0.0001,\n    bbox=box\n)\n\n\n\n\nWe can do arbitrary calculations on this data as well. Here we calculate NDVI, a widely used measure of greenness that can be used to determine tree cover.

Various attempts to estimate this indicator have been made over the past decades – the most recent and most high-resolution one currently available (and updated annually) is the Impact Observatory product based on the approach of Newbold et al and the PREDICTS database, which is available in cloud-optimized format from the Planetary Computer STAC catalog.\nAside from drowning in acronyms, this task provides a great chance to apply the same tools seen in our intro at a larger spatial scale. We will average the rasterized 100m projections from the BII over each of the 63,890 polygon tiles used in the CDFW data. Even though we are now dealing with a raster layer that involves a very derived product (BII) from a different provider (Planetary Computer), and a much larger set of polygons from a different source and in different scale and projection, the process is almost identical to the intro example.\n\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ngdalcubes::gdalcubes_options(parallel=24*2)\n\nCDFW uses a hex-based tiling scheme for their data products. Note that these pre-date the modern H3 hex tiling system, so do not provide the magic of hierarchical (zoom level) tiles. CDFW makes the ACE GIS Data freely available, but in one large zip archive. The ACE data includes may different layers all using the same hex-based tiles. The layer we pull here draws from their summary rankings on Terrestrial Irreplacability of species biodiversity.\nHere I’ll use a public mirror on a Berkeley-based server for a more cloud-native access pattern so we don’t have to download the whole thing. We also index this in a simple stac catalog\n\nurl &lt;- \"/vsicurl/https://minio.carlboettiger.info/public-biodiversity/ACE_summary/ds2715.gdb\"\n\n\nace &lt;- st_read(url) \n\n\ntm_shape(ace) + tm_polygons(fill = \"RwiRankEco\", col=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Biodiversity Intactness Index COG tiles from Planetary Computer using STAC search:\n\nbox &lt;- st_bbox(st_transform(ace, 4326))\nitems &lt;-\n  stac(\"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1\") |&gt;\n  stac_search(collections = \"io-biodiversity\",\n              bbox = c(box),\n              limit = 1000) |&gt;\n  post_request() |&gt;\n  items_sign(sign_fn = sign_planetary_computer())\n\nCreated a desired cube view\n\ncube &lt;- gdalcubes::stac_image_collection(items$features, asset_names = \"data\")\nbox &lt;- st_bbox(ace)\nv &lt;- cube_view(srs = \"EPSG:3310\",\n               extent = list(t0 = \"2020-07-01\", t1 = \"2020-07-31\",\n                                left = box[1], right = box[3],\n                                top = box[4], bottom = box[2]),\n               dx = 100, dy=100, dt = \"P1M\")\n\nQ &lt;- raster_cube(cube,v)\n\nQuick plot of the data at requested cube resolution.\n\nQ |&gt; plot(col=viridisLite::viridis(30), nbreaks=31)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract mean value of the BII for each hex.\n\nbii &lt;- Q |&gt; gdalcubes::extract_geom(ace, FUN=mean)\n\n\n\nView the average BII index values by ACE hexagon:\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\n\n# color palette\nviridis &lt;- tm_scale_continuous(values = viridisLite::viridis(30))\n\nbii &lt;- ace |&gt;\n  tibble::rowid_to_column(\"FID\") |&gt; \n  left_join(bii)\n\ntm_shape(bii) + \n  tm_polygons(fill = \"data\", col=NA, fill.scale = viridis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s zoom in manually:\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nsf = st_bbox(c(xmin=-123, ymin=38.5, xmax=-122, ymax=37.5), crs=4326)\ntm_shape(bii, bbox = sf) + \n  tm_polygons(fill = \"data\", col=NA,\n              fill.scale = viridis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have the data in convenient and familiar data structures, it is easy to analyze.

This task is somewhat different than ones we have considered previously, because instead of extracting data from a continuous cube in space & time, we have only discrete points in space and time we wish to access. Downloading files representing entirety of space or continuous ranges in time is thus particularly inefficient. Here we will try and pluck out only the sample points we need.\nThis design is a nice chance to illustrate workflows that depend directly on URLs, without leveraging the additional metadata that comes from STAC.\n\nlibrary(earthdatalogin)\nlibrary(rstac)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(stars)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(gdalcubes)\n\n\n# handle earthdata login\nedl_netrc()\n\nWe begin by reading in our turtle data from a spreadsheet and converting the latitude/longitude columns to a spatial vector (spatial points features) object using sf:\n\nturtles &lt;- \n  read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-opensci/NOAAHackDays-2024/main/r-tutorials/data/occ_all.csv\",\n           show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt; \n  st_as_sf(coords = c(\"decimalLongitude\", \"decimalLatitude\"))\n\nst_crs(turtles) &lt;- 4326 # lon-lat coordinate system\n\n\ndates &lt;- turtles |&gt; distinct(date) |&gt; pull(date)\n\nWe have 13222 data points, including 1695 unique dates that stretch from 2004-12-14 to 2019-10-17.\nLet’s take a quick look at the distribution of the data (coloring by date range):\n\n# Quick plot of the turtle data\npal &lt;- tmap::tm_scale_ordinal(5)\ntm_basemap(\"CartoDB.DarkMatter\") + \n  tm_shape(turtles) + tm_dots(\"date\", fill.scale = pal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearching for NASA sea-surface-temperature data is somewhat tricky, since the search interfaces take only date ranges, not specific dates.

    "text": "We show how to run existing NASA data workflows on the cloud, in parallel, without a cloud service account using your laptop.\nNASA recently announced completion of the transfer of some 59 petabytes of data to the Amazon cloud – a core component of NASA’s Transformation to Open Science (TOPS) mission. Researchers are frequently told that to take advantage of such “cloud data” they will need to pay (or find a grant or other program to pay) for cloud computing resources. This approach is sometimes describes as “send the compute to the data”. While this narrative is no doubt beneficial to Amazon Inc, it exacerbates inequity and is often misleading. The purpose of having data in a cloud storage platform is not just to make it faster to access that data on rented cloud computing platforms. The high bandwith and high disk speeds provided by these systems can be just as powerful when you provide your own compute. Consistent with NASA’s vision, this means that high-performance access is free\n\nNASA Earth science data have been freely openly and available to all users since EOSDIS became operational in 1994. Under NASA’s full and open data policy, all NASA mission data (along with the algorithms, metadata, and documentation associated with these data) must be freely available to the public. This means that anyone, anywhere in the world, can access the more than 59 PB of NASA Earth science data without restriction\n\nAll we need is software that can treat the cloud storage as if it were local storage: a virtual filesystem. The ability to do this – the HTTP range request standard – has been around for over two decades and is widely implemented in open source software. Unfortunately, many users and workflows are stuck in an old model that assumes individual files must always be downloaded first. We even see this in workflows designed to run on cloud platforms. A recent blog post by commercial platform Coiled provides a typical illustration of this. Typical of most workflows, the example relies on only a small subset of the data found in each file (specific spatial region and specific variables), but uses an approach that downloads all 500+ GB of files anyway. A faster approach will only download the range of data that we actually use. The Coiled blog post shows a full download-based workflow that takes 6.4hrs to complete locally, and then argues that by adding some extra code and paying Amazon for compute time, the same workflow can run much faster. Here we will consider the same workflow again, but this time make it much faster just by removing the download loop and running it from a local machine for free. We also compare a second way that dispatches via a different virtual filesystem approach and is even faster.\n\nimport earthaccess\nimport rioxarray\nimport rasterio\nimport xarray as xr\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nresults = earthaccess.search_data(\n    short_name=\"MUR-JPL-L4-GLOB-v4.1\",\n    temporal=(\"2020-01-01\", \"2021-12-31\"),\n    #temporal=(\"2019-01-01\", \"2019-01-31\"),\n)\n\nGranules found: 729\n\n\n\n\nRather than tediously downloading the entirety of each file and then manually looping over each one to open, read, and concatinate as shown in the Coiled Demo, we can simply open the whole set in one go. This lazy read method allows us to then range-request only the subset of data we need from each file, thanks to earthaccess using a cloud-native reads over http via the python fsspec package. We can then issue the usual xarray operations to process and plot the data, treating the remote source as if it were already sitting on our local disk. This approach is quite fast, works from any machine, and does not require spending money on AWS. (note that fsspec package, which is doing the core magic of allowing us to treat the remote filesystem as if it were a local filesystem, is not explicitly visible in this workflow, but earthaccess has taken care of it for us).\nNote this code is also simpler and more concise than the implementation shown in download-based workflow. Setting up the fsspec connections takes about 29 minutes. because the evaluation is lazy, most of the computation only occurs at the last step, when we create the plot, which takes about 46 minutes.\n\n%%time\nfiles = earthaccess.open(results)\nds = xr.open_mfdataset(files,\n                       decode_times=False, \n                       data_vars=['analysed_sst', 'sea_ice_fraction'], \n                       concat_dim=\"time\", \n                       combine=\"nested\",\n                       parallel=True)\n\nOpening 729 granules, approx size: 505.34 GB\nCPU times: user 2min 12s, sys: 35.9 s, total: 2min 48s\nWall time: 29min 35s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%time\ndds = ds.sel(lon=slice(-93, -76), lat=slice(41, 49))\ncond = (dds.sea_ice_fraction &lt; 0.15) | np.isnan(dds.sea_ice_fraction)\nresult = dds.analysed_sst.where(cond)\n\nCPU times: user 21.3 ms, sys: 0 ns, total: 21.3 ms\nWall time: 19.4 ms\n\n\n\n%%time\nresult.std(\"time\").plot(figsize=(14, 6), x=\"lon\", y=\"lat\")\n\n/home/jovyan/.virtualenvs/spatial/lib/python3.10/site-packages/dask/array/numpy_compat.py:51: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide\n  x = np.divide(x1, x2, out)\n\n\nCPU times: user 3min 51s, sys: 1min 28s, total: 5min 19s\nWall time: 46min 19s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA different virtual filesystem approach is available through GDAL. While fsspec tries to provide a generic POSIX-like interface to remote files, the GDAL VSI is specifically optimized for spatial data and often considerably faster. The rioxarray package provides a drop-in engine to xarray’s open_mfdataset that uses GDAL. (Aside – at least some of the other netcdf engines supported by xarray should also be able to natively perform range requests over URLs to data without needing the fsspec layer added by earthaccess, and may have better performance. This case is not illustrated in this notebook). Here we’ll use the GDAL VSI.\nBecause the NASA EarthData are behind a security layer, using the URLs directly instead of earthaccess with fsspec requires a little extra handling of authentication process to make GDAL aware of the NETRC and cookie files it needs. We’ll also set some of the optional but recommended options for GDAL when using the virtual filesystem. Unfortunately this makes our code look a bit verbose – ideally packages like rioxarray would take care of these things.\nNote the GDAL is about 3x faster at setting up the virtual filesystem, and a little faster in the xarray/dask dispatch to compute the plot. (When this approach is combined with metadata from a STAC catalog, it does not need to read individual file metadata and the first step can become almost instant).\n\n%%time\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport os\nfrom pathlib import Path\ncookies = os.path.expanduser(\"~/.urs_cookies\")\nPath(cookies).touch()\n\n## pull out the URLs\ndata_links = [granule.data_links(access=\"external\") for granule in results]\nurl_links = [f'{link[0]}' for link in data_links]\n\n\n# and here we go\nwith rasterio.Env(GDAL_INGESTED_BYTES_AT_OPEN=\"32000\",\n                  GDAL_HTTP_MULTIPLEX=\"YES\",\n                  GDAL_HTTP_MERGE_CONSECUTIVE_RANGES=\"YES\",\n                  GDAL_HTTP_VERSION=\"2\",\n                  GDAL_NUM_THREADS=\"ALL_CPUS\",\n                  GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN=\"EMPTY_DIR\",\n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEFILE=cookies, \n                  GDAL_HTTP_COOKIEJAR=cookies, \n                  GDAL_HTTP_NETRC=True):\n    ds1 = xr.open_mfdataset(url_links, \n                           engine = \"rasterio\", \n                           concat_dim=\"time\", \n                           combine=\"nested\",\n                           )\n\nCPU times: user 47.7 s, sys: 3.78 s, total: 51.4 s\nWall time: 11min 48s\n\n\n\n%%time\ndds = ds1.sel(x=slice(18000-9300, 18000-7600), y = slice(9000+4100,9000+4900))\ndds.analysed_sst.std(\"time\").plot(figsize=(14, 6), x=\"x\", y=\"y\")\n\nCPU times: user 2min 13s, sys: 3min 13s, total: 5min 27s\nWall time: 32min 55s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GDAL VSI is already widely used under the hood by python packages working with cloud-optimized geotiff (COG) files (e.g. via odc.stac, which like the above approach also produces dask-backed xarrays), and also widely used by most other languages (e.g. R) for working with any spatial data. To GDAL, netcdf and other so-called “n-dimensional array” formats like h5, zarr are just a handful of the 160-odd formats of “raster” data it supports, along with formats like COG and GeoTIFF files. It can be particularly powerful in more complicated workflows which require spatially-aware operations such as reprojection and aggregation. The GDAL VSI can sometimes be considerably faster than fsspec, expecially when configured for cloud-native access. The nusiance of these environmental variables aside, it can also be considerably easier to use and to generalize patterns across data formats (netcdf, zarr, COG), and across languages (R, C++, javascript, julia etc), since GDAL understands [all these formats] and is used in all of these languages, as well as in platforms such as Google Earth Engine and QGIS. This makes it a natural bridge between languages. This broad use over decades has made GDAL very powerful, and it continues to improve rapidly with frequent releases.\nFor some reason, the xarray community seems to prefer to access ncdf without GDAL, whether by relying on downloading complete files, using fsspec, or other dedicated libraries (zarr). There are possibly many reasons for this. One is a divide between the the “Geospatial Information Systems” community, that thinks of file serializations as “rasters” or “vectors”, and the “modeler” community, which thinks of data as “n-dimensional arrays”. Both have their weaknesses and the lines are frequently blurred, but one obvious manifestation is in how each one writes their netcdf files (and how much they rely on GDAL). For instance, this NASA product, strongly centered in the modeler community is sometimes sloppy about these metadata conventions, and as a result GDAL (especially older versions), might not detect all the details appropriately. Note that GDAL has failed to recognize the units of lat-long, so we have had to subset the x-y positions manually.",
